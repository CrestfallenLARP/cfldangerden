<h2> Two Day Town Event - {{ $event_date.Format "January 02, 2006 (Monday)" }} </h2>
<p></p>
<p>A two day town event is designed for 10 to 30 players and 10+ NPCs. The players will take part in planned story adventures as well as additional adventures including lineage jobs, guild jobs, stockpiles, cards in the woods, and random encounters.  These adventures may include combat, puzzles, problem solving, role-playing, trading, and more.  Non-Combat players are welcome as there are a number of skills, abilities, and stories that may/will not require combat.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Friday night</b>: is typically focused around getting into character and planning Saturdays work (signing up for jobs in folders, discussing recent goings on, reading the All-of Branch paper, scouting the site, crafting, gathering, etc.). Some small planned adventures may occur on Friday, but this is rare.  </li>
<li><b>Saturday</b> will focus on adventures, random encounters, and storyline.  Plot will shut down between 11PM and 1AM depending on site and plot requirements. </li>
<li><b>Sunday</b> will focus on cleaning up loose ends such as adventures that needed to be rescheduled, as well as crafting, gathering, and acting among players.</li>

<p><b>Gathering Hall</b>: The gathering hall is where players may access lineage and guild folders, roll for their gathering skill checks, and finalize their crafted items.  The gathering hall will be open for operation from game start until 1AM on Friday into Saturday, 8 AM until 1AM Saturday into Sunday, and 8AM until game end on Sunday.  These times are subject to change, but will be clearly listed at the gathering hall.  Players may use the crafting or gathering skills no more than 2 times while the gathering hall is closed and must complete their dice rolls before crafting or gathering again.</p>

<p><b>Overnight Consideration</b>: Due to the close proximity of our sleeping arrangements we ask that all players respect the quiet hours of 1AM until 8AM within communal sleeping spaces.
