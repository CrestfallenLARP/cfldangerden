# Buying Skill Categories

Characters start with access to the General and the characters lineage Category for free. Other than these, the first Category a Character purchases will cost 5 CP. Each additional Category will cost 5 more than the last purchased. (1st is 5, 2nd is 10, 3rd is 15, etc). Once a Category is purchased, a Character may then purchase skills at their listed cost. Skills found on multiple lists may have different costs. The cost of a skill will always be the cost when purchased. No CP will be refunded if a Category is later unlocked with a different cost unless stated in a particular skill.
