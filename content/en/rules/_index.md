## Introduction

Hello and welcome to Crestfallen LARP! Writing a rulebook is difficult because people learn in multiple different ways. People can be categorized into many different learning styles such as visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinaesthetic (learning by doing). Each person will take the rulebook and use it in their own way. This intro is intended to give some guidance as to what LARP is, how Crestfallen LARP is intended to be portrayed, the goals of the book, and suggestions on ways to approach making a character with the book.

We hope to make it easy to jump in and play Crestfallen LARP. Our members are available to help make you feel comfortable about your choices and assist you along the way. Feel free to use our resources such as Website ([www.CrestfallenLARP.com](www.CrestfallenLARP.com)), Email ([Crestfallenlarp@gmail.com](mailto:Crestfallenlarp@gmail.com)), and Social Media ([CrestfallenOwner](https://www.facebook.com/CrestfallenOwner/ ) on Facebook) at any time.

### What is LARP

LARP stands for Live Action Role Play(ing). The short explanation of this is acting with other people in public. The thought of this can be scary to some people, but this book is here to tell you that it can be lots of fun and very rewarding. In a LARP environment that we are discussing there are number of things to keep in mind.

- The LARP game defines the world that all characters interact with.
- The rules define what players can/can't do and explains how the game works.
- The players determine what they want their characters want to do and use the game rules and their acting to do these actions.
- The player is only in charge of their character.

For more information on what LARP is or can be, feel free to check out the [What is LARP](https://crestfallenlarp.com/blog/2020/01/02/what-is-larp/) article on the Crestfallen LARP website.

### What is Crestfallen LARP: (Beren's Hopes)

Crestfallen LARP is intended to be a frontier fantasy LARP game. The intent is to have a feeling of exploring the game world, building a community, fighting the dangers of the wilds, making magical and scientific discoveries, recovering resources, crafting fantastical equipment, and possible danger around every corner. The rules are intended to be simple to pick up for new players but nuanced for those that wish to delve into them. We want to cultivate a culture of teamwork between combat and non-combat characters and growing together as a community both in and out of game. While player versus player conflict is allowed, the laws in game are always maintained by the plot staff. Every player has their own abilities to make decisions and act on them without other players having power over another. A character MAY attempt to order, force, or lie to another character to do what they want, but no player character will ever be granted authority over another characters actions.

### Goals of this Book

This rulebook attempts to accomplish the following goals

- Clearly state the [Code of Conduct]({{< ref "#code-of-conduct" >}}) that all Crestfallen LARP players are expected to follow.
- Explain the core concepts of the Crestfallen LARP rules.
- Explain ways to make a Character so an Attendee can participate in a Crestfallen Event.
- Describe the core story and lineage information of the world of Katalossa.
- Act as a resource for clarifications on the Crestfallen LARP rules during gameplay.

### Disclaimer

We understand that learning the entire rulebook is difficult and mistakes will happen. While we want everyone to understand all of the rules as much as possible, we have a very friendly and understanding community. We want to lift each other up.

Players should review the [Code of Conduct]({{< ref "#code-of-conduct" >}}) and [Philosophies]({{< ref "#philosophies" >}}) first, as these impact the safety and expectations of all attendees. After this, the player should learn the rules systems that they are interacting with most as their character. Next, the [conditions]({{< ref "/rules/conditions" >}}) and [combat]({{< ref "#combat" >}}) sections are important to know for character survival. Finally, the players should review any rules they have skipped as they may be useful to know later on.

### Parts of a Character

A player’s character (PC for short) is how they interact with the game world and is broken into the following parts

- **Backstory**: This is the PC's history before coming to an event. This can include a number of items such as previous schooling, occupation, family, home town, minor/major events, etc.
- **Persona**: This is the PC's personality. This often times can be tied to the characters backstory, but does not have to be. Examples of persona may include the PC's temper, mannerisms, quirks, irritants, etc.
- **Character Sheet**: These are the abilities that the PC can perform within the rules of the Crestfallen LARP game. Items found on the Character Sheet include lineage, Body Points, Essence Points, Stamina Points, Energy Points, [Skill Categories]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories" >}}), [Skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}), Bank Funds, and notes regarding the character.
- **Costuming and Gear**: These are the props that the player uses for the PC.These may include Lineage prosthetics/paint, weapons, potions, wands, and tagged items.

## Character Building Advice

As mentioned before, everyone will use this rulebook differently to make characters. Here are a number of suggested ways to make a character. All players should review the [Code of Conduct]({{< ref "#code-of-conduct" >}}) and [Philosophies]({{< ref "#philosophies" >}}) sections of the book first due to their importance mentioned in the disclaimer. 

Also remember that you need to leave room for your character to grow. Do not purchase [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) that you do not have (or plan to have in the near future) the props or ability to use.

Finally it is important to remember that you are one character in a bigger community. You cannot do everything and will often need the help of others to accomplish goals. It is not suggested to build an anti-social character or a character that is does not have a core [skill category]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories" >}}) that helps express the characters identity.

### How to make a character when focusing on story/lineage

A player who wants to focus on story should first look at all of the In Game information about the game world and lineages. These sections include Lineages, Mixed Lineages, [Lineage Skill Categories]({{< ref "/rules/lineage_skill_categories" >}}), and the Persona Guide. This reading will give players basic information on Katalossa (the Crestfallen game world), the lineages of the Inspired, and the [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) that are special to each lineage. After this reading, the player can determine which lineage they would like to play and different Persona and Backstory elements. Once the Backstory and Persona is established, the player may already have an idea of what style of character they want to build on their Character Sheet. The player should review the different Points Systems to understand the different types and how they work. Following this they should focus on the Combat, Magic, and [Skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) system to determine their [skill categories]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories" >}}) and [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}). The player will end with creating the costuming and gear based on what they require from the previous steps.

### How to make a character when focusing on skills and skill categories

A player who wants to focus on their [Skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) and [Skill Categories]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories" >}}) will first look at the [Skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) list to determine what skills they wish to take. This may include reviewing the Combat, Magic, or Crafting sections to understand how these work. Once a player determines what skills they would like to have, they will usually then look that the lineage choices to find out which lineage has the most discounts or best [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) to complement their skill choices. After this the player will create a Persona and Backstory based on the [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) and lineage they have ultimately chosen. The player will end with creating the costuming and gear based on what they require from the previous steps.

### How to make a character when focusing on physical ability

A player needs to take into account their own physical abilities. If a player is limited in what activities they wish to take part in or medically are limited on activities, the player should first review the [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) list to determine their limitations. This may determine what kinds of [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) the player may take, what lineage abilities or props they may use, and what counted actions they may need to be aware of. Once [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) and lineage are determined, the player will create a Persona and Backstory based on the previous choices and limitations. The player will end with creating the costuming and gear based on what they require from the previous steps.

### How to make a character when focusing on costuming and gear

A player will focus on costuming and gear that they already own if there are major budget issues. The player should focus on [Skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}), [Skill Categories]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories" >}}), and Lineage based on the gear they already posses or that do not require gear. After this the player will create a Persona and Backstory based on the [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) and lineage they have ultimately chosen. The player will end with creating the costuming and gear based on what they require from the previous steps.

## Code of Conduct

All members of Crestfallen LARP acknowledge during the check in process that they have read (or watched) and will abide by the Code of Conduct found below. This document (or its videos) encompasses Sportsmanship, Player Safety, and Social Contract items between the members of Crestfallen LARP, its ruling organization, and staff. All members, regardless of station within the organization, are bound by these items. Crestfallen LARP and its members will not be held accountable if a member falsely claims they have watched or read this document or its updates when they have not actually done so. This Code of Conduct extends to all interactions to pages that Crestfallen LARP manages online including social media, forums, and websites.

**Content Warning**: We believe that drama is important for any LARP game experience. As such, plot within our LARP may be difficult or troubling for some people emotionally. Attending members consent that the core game mechanics simulate combat which may include violence, abuse, injury, body dismemberment, kidnapping, suicide, self-injurious behavior, death, dying, blood, etc…

**Real World Politics and Religion**: are not depicted at our events and should not be discussed. This includes use of typical holy symbols, holidays, traditions, and dogmas. Crestfallen LARP does not include Deity-similar creatures that are all knowing/seeing in plotlines (HOWEVER, a creature may lie and say that they are). Plotlines may use Crestfallen versions of creatures found in different religions, but they are our own parody and are never intended to cause harm or insult.

**Mental Illness and Mental Health Disorders**: are difficult subjects to tackle. Plot will never knowingly include a Mental Illness or Mental Health Disorder as the primary catalyst for a character to be good/evil. Members may choose to use/include their own Mental Illness or Mental Health Disorder in their character backstory or roleplay. A member may include a Mental Illness or Mental Health Disorder to their character backstory or roleplay if they are very knowledgeable of the item in question and represent it authentically. A member found to be playing a Mental Illness or Mental Health Disorder inauthentically or purposely disrespectfully may be asked to remove it from the character, to make a new character, or asked not to attend events in the future (with appropriate warnings).

**Pregnancy**: may be discussed as part of story but may **NEVER** be depicted in game by any member (Plot or Players). (May be discussed and changed via player base vote)

**Taboo Subjects**: Crestfallen LARP will **NEVER** include any depictions of the following items in any portion of its story, member backstory, plot, etc. These items do not occur in our fantasy based world and it is not the intent of Crestfallen LARP to deny the existence of these themes in the real world.

- Rape
- Sexual Assault
- Slavery
- Child Abuse

**Mental Health**: While LARP is a great opportunity to work through personal struggles and reduce stress, Crestfallen LARP is a purely recreational game and is not a substitute for help from a mental health professional. The mental health of all members is important to us for the fun and safety of everyone involved. Additional Safety Mechanics and Consent rules are discussed later.*If you are considering suicide, please remember help is available. Call, Text or Chat 988 for the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline in the United States.*

### Sportsmanship

Like other games, sports, and physical activities, good sportsmanship is vital to a LARP game.
Members should know, understand, and appreciate the rules and policies of Crestfallen LARP. The spirit of good sportsmanship depends on conformance to the intent of a rule as well as how the rule is written. If a “loophole”, “work around”, or other variation occurs where the intent of the rule and the written rule does not seem to match, members must make this information known to gain clarification and have the rules amended as soon as possible.

Fair play and honesty regarding Out of Game rules and discussions with staff are mandatory. Characters at Crestfallen do not need to be honest, but members must be. Playing fairly and honestly helps in building a sense of community, promote equal and equitable opportunity to access the game, and ensure that members are not targeted in a positive or negative fashion.

Recognition and appreciation of skilled performances in combat, roleplaying, crafting, and/or knowledge of the rules is expected and appreciated. LARP games are both performances and game play. Members should be respectful for the time and energy that other members put into the LARP. Recognizing and acknowledging these helps to encourage the community to grow.

Respect for staff, marshals, plot, npcs, and EMTs is vital. Marshals should be impartial arbitrators of the rules who are trained to make the best decision possible at the time to continue game in a safe, timely, and fair way. Staff, Plot, and NPCs work to ensure the LARP runs as smoothly as possible and provide as many opportunities for fun interaction as possible. EMTs are available to help determine the best medical options available if there is an emergency on site. Mistakes can be made by any member of Crestfallen LARP, but it is important for members to accept and abide by the decisions made by these members when they must be made. When it is appropriate (after emergency, during downtime, closing ceremonies, after event, etc.) the staff/safety member will review what occurred and clarify the situation to make sure things are handled appropriately next time.

Respect for all members is required. While people may not like each other, it is important to maintain a cordial and tolerant level of respect for all members. Crestfallen LARP will not tolerate any purposeful disrespect between its members.

Every member has fun in different ways and with different aspects of LARP. All members should do their best to contribute to the enjoyment of all players.

All members (including Owners/Staff/Safety members) may be questioned regarding their actions and/or the rules. If there is a discrepancy or concern regarding this, there will be a staff structure in place where questions can be raised. Crestfallen LARP and its Staff can only help if it hears concerns or complaints.

Modeling proper sportsmanship will help influence others to do the same, making a positive environment for all members to enjoy.

### Illegal Drugs and Alcohol

Crestfallen LARP does not allow the use of illegal drugs and alcohol during our events. Members suspected to be under the influence of such substances may be removed from participation, asked to leave (if it is safe for them to do so), have law enforcement involved, and/or be asked to not return.

## Safety Mechanics and Consent

It is our belief that storytelling requires tension and stakes. These often require members to deal with items that may make them uncomfortable out of game. The following policies and mechanics are in place for member safety physically and mentally.

**Affirmative Consent –** Based off of a sexual violence prevention mechanic, we at Crestfallen LARP want to ensure that all physical actions between parties are based upon clearly given consent. When taking part in any physical roleplay that is not expressly permitted within the rules, all parties must knowingly, voluntarily, and mutually agree to consent to the roleplay. This consent may be given through words, the ok hand symbol, or actions as long as they clearly convey consent. Consent may be revoked at any point, for any reason, by any party. Consent must be granted every time physical roleplay takes place unless previously negotiated and notated on a character sheet (note, this consent may also be revoked at any time).

**Age Requirement –** Crestfallen participants must be 18 years old to attend as we deal with mature subject matter and language.

**Armband (Orange) –** Orange arm/headbands denote a player who is a non-combatant. A player may be a non-combatant for any reason including but not limited to the following: Illness, Injury, Anxiety, Age, Stress, Disability, Mental Health, EMT Advisement. Additionally, players that are deemed unsafe with combat may be given non-combat status for a limited duration. Non-combat players may not be targeted with weapon or spell attacks. Ranged attacks that accidentally strike a non-combat player will be treated as a “[resist]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#resist" >}})”. Non-combat characters may not use any skill from any [Skill Category]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories/" >}}) containing the word Combat. The only exception to this is [Energy]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#energy" >}}) which may not be used in combat, but may be used for crafting or condition removal following a battle. All players may use the Killing Blow counted action on a non-combatant by pointing their weapon at the target from an arm’s length away rather than physically touching them. This action is stopped through normal means or if a combat player comes within arms reach of the attacker. A character that is feigning injury/death must make themselves known in order to prevent a Killing Blow in this fashion.

**Armband (Green) –** Green arm/headbands denote a member of the plot team or marshal (PC or NPC). These staff members should be contacted if there is a rules dispute, rules question, cabin [thievery]({{< ref "#thievery " >}}),  [pick pocket]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#pick-pocket" >}}), or similar situation. Not every plot member or marshal may be able to assist in every issue, but they should be able to point a player in the correct direction for assistance.

**Armband (Blue) –** Blue arm/headbands denote an EMT. If there is a medical emergency an EMT is called for their medical knowledge to take charge of a situation and make the best decision possible. EMTs are volunteers and will do their best to make fair and safe judgements regarding player safety. EMTs rulings must be followed by all players to the best of their ability. If a player disregards an EMT ruling, they may be asked to leave or not be allowed to attend future events. Crestfallen LARP is a play at your own risk game. As such players should know their physical limitations and do their best to practice self-care as necessary.

**Assumed Consent –** While Crestfallen believes that players should ask for affirmative consent for physical actions, there is an Assumed Consent that players are taking part in a physical game and that certain touch is required. Crestfallen LARP assumes that all players consent to physical contact with all weapons, spell ammo, and approved game props. Additionally, all players are assumed to consent on physical contact on the arms from the wrist to the shoulder for the purposes of spell touch casting, carrying, and counted actions. This assumed consent does NOT allow a player to grab, pull, or push forcefully. This assumed consent also does NOT allow a player to touch another player in a way to make them feel uncomfortable. This consent may be revoked at any time, for any reason.

**Clothing Requirements –** All attendees must be in appropriate clothing to take part in an active LARP game according to public decency requirements as well as appropriate clothing for the weather. Underwear/Shirtless gameplay is never acceptable.

**EMT –** If a medical emergency is taking place, a Pause must be called directly by the call of EMT which must be called and echoed until one arrives or it is known that one is in transit. EMTs wear blue armbands and make medical decisions to the best of their ability. Crestfallen LARP is a play at your own risk game. As such players should know their physical limitations and do their best to practice self-care as necessary.

**Look Down –** If a player has a problem with a situation that is going on in the game, they may opt out at any time by looking down and covering their eyes with a hand like a visor. The player and character leave the scene. The player should not be stopped or questioned regarding why the opt out has occurred. If there is an altercation between two PCs that causes a Look Down bow-out, the scene may need to follow a Negotiated Roleplay to ensure the story can go on in a safe but cohesive way. This should only be attempted after all parties have had a chance to analyze the situation and feel comfortable talking with all parties along with a plot representative. No player will be asked or forced to give any reasoning why the bow-out occurred, but all parties will be asked to give input to how the situation can be resolved.

**Negotiated Roleplay –** Negotiated Roleplay is where parties decide what will happen during a particular planned interaction between two or more individuals. Crestfallen LARP wishes to use this type of planned roleplay as a remedy to situations where players or characters bow-out of a scene for private personal reasons.Additionally, this mechanic is highly encouraged for any and all relationship dynamics at Crestfallen LARP. Relationships In Game and Out of Game are based upon communication. It is highly suggested that players plan these relationships well in advance and with appropriate safety checks to ensure all parties remain comfortable with the situation. This is not required, but highly recommended.

**OK Check In –** Players are encouraged to check on each other during stressful roleplay situations using an OK check in. A player who is concerned with a current situation should visibly show the OK hand sign to those they wish to check in with. Players may then give a thumbs up to continue, a thumbs down to show that there are issues and they wish to stop or fix the situation, or a level hand to show that they are unsure or things are starting to cause an issue. At this point roleplay may continue if all thumbs up are shown and a “Pause” should be called if there is a thumbs down to determine the problem and fix any situation before things get out of hand or to allow the player to use Look Down to walk away. A “so-so” wave is up to the asking players discretion but should indicate that a change in roleplay should occur.

https://participationsafety.wordpress.com/2016/09/09/toolkit-the-ok-check-in/

**Out Of Game Headband (Pink) –** Sometimes a player needs to be out of game. There are many reasons for this such as a way to remove themselves from stressful roleplay, medical emergencies, phone calls, or interacting with the staff of the game. Often plot staff may need to show they are out of game to convey rulings, set up modules, or traveling without causing the other players to be alarmed. A player wearing a bright pink solid headband is out of game and should be ignored unless prompted by the wearer. A player should contact a staff member prior to going out of game if time allows. Bathrooms, vehicle, active cooking areas, restricted medical sleep areas, and the NPC hub area are always considered out of game unless otherwise clarified.

**Pause –** This is how the game stops for safety, emergency, or plot reasons. To stop game a player must call out “Pause”. All players must echo the call “Pause” when heard. All players must look down at the ground and kneel if possible. During the pause the person who called it and plot staff will determine the reason for the Pause and handle it appropriately. Once the reason for the pause is completed it will be asked if there is any reason the game should not continue. If there is, the pause is maintained to fix the new situation. If there is no reason the call will go out “3, 2, 1, Start”. During a pause players should not look around, gather gear/items, or converse unless it is part of the Pause.

### Additional Policies

#### Thievery

Stealing things in Crestfallen LARP must be very closely watched. A Marshal (Green Armband) must be contacted to steal from a cabin, public area, or when using game skills to steal. Characters may only steal in game cards and leaves from other players because they are the property of Crestfallen LARP and not the players themselves. To steal a weapon or other tagged item, the physical item must be taken and held by the player for at least one hour. Following this hour, the item must be given directly to a Marshall so that it may be returned to the player and the tag retrieved from the person who was robbed. A player may NEVER steal the physical property of another player.

#### NPC Requirements

NPCs are required to have appropriate footwear and clothing for the weather. This clothing should include neutral base layers for costuming such as plain brown, grey, or black. Additionally, NPCs must have a sealable belt pouch for carrying Leaves and Resource cards for distribution as treasure. NPCs who pre-register for an event may gain additional information regarding characters and/or monsters that they will be playing. Players who bring additional costuming to make the character/monster more realistic or interesting may gain additional CP for their efforts.

## Philosophies

While philosophies are not rules or policies that we enforce, the following are guiding forces that we use in the development, organization, and running of Crestfallen. These may change from time to time, but we feel it is important the those that attend our game are aware of these items.

### Core Out of Game Philosophies

**Attendees must “buy in”** – Players who don’t try to act as their characters, speak out of character, or discuss things out of game in front of others are a distraction for those who wish to immerse themselves in the game world.

**Fair character progression** – Crestfallen LARP links CP to attendance. No one gets CP for secret staff meetings, one days, or other events that only a few people are invited. All events are publicly advertised and everyone who is eligible to attend may. Additionally, all CP bonuses can be earned through work, donations or paid for. If a player does not attend an event, then they do not gain CP.

**Everyone must be involved in site care** – Everyone helps to clean and maintain the camps and locations we use. Players who do not do a fair cleanup will not gain CP for the event and may be asked not to attend future events.

**Transparency** – All funds will be recorded and available for players to see. Our primary goal is for the game to be self-sustainable. When this is possible, we will focus on investing back into the game, donating to causes, and eventually paying all staff members. No staff member (including ownership) will be paid until all can be paid.

**Accountability** – Crestfallen LARP wants its players to have faith in its staff and members. Players are encouraged to talk to staff with any issues and disagreements they have with rules, rulings, and the way the game is managed. There will be a yearly meeting where players can vote on new items, changes to the rules, and voice their opinions on matters that are important to them.

**Low-cost barriers to entry** – Costuming can be expensive. This is why the Human lineage is based on Western wear and time frame. Western wear is easy to acquire from used clothing stores and family hand me downs. Additionally, Crestfallen LARP may have opportunities to sell used or discounted items or make bulk purchases from suppliers to help lessen the costs on players.

**Basic rules are easy to follow** – The rulebook and its documents are written to be easy to follow and not require a ton of memorization. Most [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) require the player using the ability to know what it does. Most conditions and [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) are made using basic language so that new or confused players can make logical choices regarding them.

### Core In Game Philosophies

**Monsters are always evil** – Sometimes games like to challenge character morals. Crestfallen will only do this with PC lineage NPCs. When a character is fighting a monster, they may always know both in and out of game that the character is evil.

**NPC run Governments and Organizations are always good** – Governments and Organizations in game are always on the side of the characters. While it is not realistic, these groups need to be idealistic to protect the players on an Out of Game level. Corrupt politicians and dispensers of justice can easily ruin the game for the players.

**Plot never gives players power over other players** - Just as stated above corrupt power can ruin the game for players and drive them away from the game. A player may feel they are doing the correct thing when using power over players, but instead they may be breeding hatred and anger that can cause many problems for the game and the other players overall.

**Crafting and economy is in the players hands** – Players should be the driving economic force. If the game artificially creates an economy, it often becomes unrealistic. Additionally, if everyone can buy things from NPC merchants that can create things because plot says so, then crafters and non-combat players feel less useful and have a harder time selling their wares.

**In game laws as a guide to protect players** – In game laws are written to protect players and make sense with the in game story. These laws allow characters/players who are wronged to have an outlet to treat them fairly and equitably.

**Combat and non-combat players have opportunities to feel important** – We are writing modules and missions to allow for roleplay and combat solutions. Additionally, we want crafters, info gatherers, and merchants to have ways to impact the story through player agency.

**Fair access to story for all players** - All players interact with plot differently. Often times quiet players miss out because they are unsure of what they can and can’t do. We have multiple methods of gaining access to story such as plot cards in the woods, newsletter modules, lineage modules, organization modules, and tradition plot modules.

**Evil characters –** Evil characters can be fun IF they don’t take away the player agency of other characters. We want to promote evil characters against NPCs as well as allowing PVP interactions. Crestfallen LARP wants to promote a community feel, so we always ask that an evil character has a good reason to take part in PVP. We will always do our part to ensure all players are having fun and that intentional griefing of a player or character will not be tolerated.

## Persona Guide

A player’s character (PC for short) is how they interact with the game world. This includes several items such as a Character Sheet, Persona, Costume, and Backstory. This section will be focusing on game world information to help a character create a persona and backstory. If you are a new player, new to Crestfallen, or just looking for some help, please check out our videos coming soon to CrestfallenLarp on Youtube and/or other social media.

### So Our Story Begins

Katalossa is a small world with two continents and hundreds of islands. It thrives with Essence, the pure energy of life that fuels creation. It surges with Energy, the power to create magic with thought and intention. While life on Katalossa may be difficult at times, there is a potential within its boundaries that few can ignore.

At its creation, the lands of Katalossa were wild and dangerous. The creatures of the world fought over land, resources, and power. Greed ruled the world and chaos ran rampant. Time passed and many creatures started to come to the realization that there could be more than wealth and fighting. Several of the different lineages formed organizations and governments which helped to bring law to the world. These formations were not perfect, causing wars between them.

More time passed and these groups grew and changed. Eventually the battles between them ended and peace was achieved among them with the formation of the Inspired. This loose affiliation of lineages agreed on many fundamental principles of life and law. Each of the governments would maintain its own sovereignty in their own lands but would agree to follow these principles among them. United in vision, the Inspired created a lasting peace for those who lived among them. Additionally, they deemed any lineage who did not agree with their principles would be called monsters and banished from the lands.

Sadly, many of the remaining lineages would not agree with these thoughts, either due to ignorance or outright malice. The monsters were killed or driven out of the lands controlled by the Inspired. Conflicts became few and far between. Hundreds of years passed allowing complacency to grow. Previously learned lessons were not brought forward into the future and many things were lost. Then came the Torrent.

![Images of the Travellers falling from portals during the Torrent.](/images/katalossa/the_torrent.png)

Countless travelers spilled onto Katalossa as an untold number of magical portals from different worlds were ripped open. While some were transported safely to land, many of the portals opened into the sky, under the water, in caverns, and in many other dangerous places around the planet. Many travelers did not survive and those who did had little to no recollection of their previous lives.

### Now It's Up To You, But Where To Start?

The beginning of the Crestfallen LARP story starts a few months following the Torrent. The citizens of the Inspired have taken in the travelers they have found. Resources are thin, but the people of Katalossa are trying their best to help those in need. Danger is coming to the world, but you need to decide what part you will play.

The following pages will give you the basic information about the story, lineages, and suggestions we have for creating a character that will fit within the world.

### Traveler Or Local Inspired

Inspired characters were born and raised on Katalossa and understand the basics of the world they live in. This is a great place to start for players that are new to LARP as the characters will learn about the world and its nuance as they do. The only requirement for an Inspired character is to follow the costuming requirements for their Lineage and to know the basics behind it. The player may choose to take part in the politics surrounding the Lineage but are not required to.

Traveler characters have found their way to Katalossa via a magical portal during the Torrent. These characters may have existed in a different game (LARP, Tabletop, or other similar media). These should be original characters of the players design (not copies of pre-existing characters from pop culture/media). This is a way to allow players who may have lost a character early in development, missed on story due to a game closing, or any other factor where a character did not meet the players standards to use the developed character in a new world. The character should only have a few memories from their previous life, as we don’t want players to hold previous grudges or thoughts that may not work well within the new game world. Players love to tell stories of their past adventure, so we don’t want to take that away. These characters should be open-minded and strive to understand their new home. These characters must be cleared with plot staff prior to introduction, to ensure they can mesh well with the game world itself.

### Lineages Of The Inspired

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
WARNING– Racism will not be tolerated at Crestfallen. Lineages are based on genetic effects and set physical characteristics that differentiate them from one another. No Lineage is based on a coloration that is used to describe a cultural group in the real world. Kinfolk and Orc are the only Lineages currently limited to coloration, and all other Lineages must use the players real world skin tone. There are no special Lineage versions, especially based on coloration (example: Sea Elves, Dark Elves, Dark Dwarves etc). No players are limited on what Lineage they play based upon their real world skin tone.
{{% /alert %}}

Lineages in Crestfallen determine some costuming requirements and [skill categories]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories" >}}) that a character may take. Additionally, all Lineages have a particular government that characters may interact with. Characters may interact with their own Lineage government group more easily than those they are not part of. Crestfallen uses these government groups to track and facilitate plot. Below is the basic info on the Lineages of Katalossa. 

*Please note, that Crestfallen does not dictate social or cultural rules for its players/characters. These government groups are guidelines for how NPCs work.*

**Dwarf** – The Dwarves of Katalossa hail from the City of Zarn among the mountains on the Western portion of the continent. This Lineage is easily recognizable by their long flowing beards. The Dwarven government is a council-based system where the primary elder of a family is granted a vote, with each family name having a say. Every family is required to have at least one member as part of the Dwarven Militia, including weapon training and/or enchanting. Dwarves do not often gravitate to magic, but when they do, they tend to focus on effects that enhance their combat skills and enchant weapons and armor.

**Elf** – The Elven Kingdom of Caernarthan is ruled by a royal family with many advisors and councils to oversee the varied affairs of government. The capital is near the center of the continent and is well protected on three sides by cliffsides and strong flowing rivers. All members of this Lineage have long pointed ears, though some additionally have small horns resembling that of a goat or a ram. Elves naturally sense the Energy of Katalossa and can often innately cast magics using this sense. Additionally, Elves seem to easily understand Enchanting and Magical Research due to their innate knowledge. Magic is widely studied by this Lineage, with little being taboo save the rules of the Inspired.

**Hauflin** – The Hauflin are a democratic society based around the city of [Port Jebbedo](https://crestfallenlarp.com/katalossa/katalossagazetteer/portjebeddo/). Every Hauflin who is interested in a matter of government may cast a vote when one is called for. This Lineage holds this duty in high regard and will often vote only when they are knowledgeable about a subject. These folks are well known for their bushy sideburns, top knot of hair, and their inquisitive nature. Hauflin can often talk themselves out of or into a fight, and are often wily enough to get themselves out of difficult situations. Rather than focusing on magic, many Hauflin tend to turn to the science of Alchemy to entertain themselves.

**Human** – Humans of Katalossa are unique in the way they have developed. This adaptable and technology minded Lineage have a long history of invention. The Kingdom of Briarwood is a hub for the newest technology to protect the Inspired. While ruled by a Royal Family, there are many businesses and groups that give council to the current ruler. Humans have been at the forefront of technology and scientific advancement in the creation of Firearms and Medical Training. Humans study any magic that may interest them, but often focus on combat magics and the melding of magic and technology. Additionally, Humans have also created innovations in fashion such as suits, overalls, and other clothing of “Western” style. (Please note: Human characters may wear western era style clothing, but may never wear items that are deemed problematic culturally or based in political portions of that time period such as military uniforms. This clothing is not limited to only American clothing of the time, but please remember to be considerate of others.)

**Kinfolk** – The Kinfolk are tied to the natural Essence of Katalossa and have taken on different animalistic traits based upon it. The Kinfolk do not have one Lineage based homeland due to their varied lifestyles and traditions. The members of this Lineage gather once per year to nominate a Speaker to act as their leader among the Inspired. This Speaker takes council from those of their Lineage to ensure the will of the people is met appropriately. Kinfolk gravitate toward magics that preserve the natural world and manipulate it for the betterment of their people.

**Orc** – The Orcs of Katalossa are green skinned humanoids that often have tusks. This Lineage tends to favor strength and honor above magical pursuits due to their homes being closer to monster controlled lands. The Orcs hold a yearly tournament in their capital of Imshcran to decide who will become their Marshal. This tournament includes physical and tactical contests, ultimately deciding who is the most fit to lead the Lineage. This Lineages is often very direct in their actions and use their natural strengths to their best advantage. Orcs that cast magic usually focus on healing their wounded allies or dealing damage directly to their enemies.

### Monsters Of Katalossa

**Gnoll** - The Gnolls of Katalossa were believed to once be members of the Kinfolk Lineage. These creatures resemble monstrous versions of hyenas with a dangerous hunger and claws to match. They wear cobbled together armor of varying types to protect themselves in battle, but rarely care for each other in a fight. Gnolls will often feed on their enemies once they have been dropped, usually resulting in broken limbs for the victims. These monsters cannot be reasoned with and do not attempt to communicate other than through threats.

**Goblin** - The Goblins of Katalossa have no idea of honor or holding to promises. Peace has been attempted many times, with these monsters however it has never lasted more than three days. Goblins are tactical, crafty, and greedy to their core. They are never content with what they have and always covet more. This means that they can sometimes be paid or tricked to not fight for short periods of time. Goblins stick together and protect one another if they can. They will never fight one of their own for payment, but they are not opposed to lying about that fact to get what they want. Goblins rarely kill their enemies outright, however they usually remove some leaves or resources to add to their loot.

**Undead** - The Undead of Katalossa had not been seen for hundreds of years, up until the Torrent occurred. These walking dead can complete complex actions and seem to understand speech and tactical fighting. While they do not have discussions, some undead can cast spells. All undead seem to have a sense for energy and magical items causing them to target foes with these abilities first. These creatures have no remorse for the living, almost always killing their foes when they have been dropped.

### Magic Of Katalossa

Energy is the source of all magic on Katalossa. This power is drawn from two separate locations around the plane. The source of Ice, Lightning, and Healing magics come from the inner core of the plane while Fire, Stone, and Harming magics come from the space above Katalossa. Spells that do not channel a particular element may be fueled by either source.

### Essence of Katalossa

Essence is the source of life on Katalossa and is said to come from the inner core of the plane itself. Essence is a resource that can be used for a variety of purposes. The most common use is the ability to come back to life from death. A spirit may return to life by giving one essence back to Katalossa, allowing their body and items to reform. The body may reform in several ways such as receiving guidance from a willing person, being rebuilt by a machine, being shunted into a new body, etc.

### The Unified Principles Of The Inspired

### Regarding Unknown Lineages

Lineages and creatures that are found outside our members and enemies may be treated as necessary on a case-by-case basis.

Likewise, it may be determined that they go against our beliefs and may become permanently at odds with us.

## How to Forge Your Character

A player’s character (PC for short) is how they interact with the game world. This includes several items such as a Character Sheet, Persona, Costume, and Backstory. This section will be focusing on the game specific Character Sheet that is required for play. If you are a new player, new to Crestfallen, or just looking for some help, please check out our Character Sandbox document and videos (coming soon to [CrestfallenLarp](https://www.youtube.com/@crestfallenlarp618) on Youtube).

### How to Build Your Character Sheet

The first physical thing that a person needs to play Crestfallen is a Character Sheet. Creating a sheet is very simple to do, however, it can require a lot of forethought. Remember to keep your persona and backstory in mind when completing your Character Sheet. Please note that players may only have two characters in the Crestfallen Database at one time. If a character is permanently killed, the player may create a new character to replace it.

### How to Complete a Character Sheet – A Step by Step Guide

- Choose the lineage of the character.
- Spend Your CP (Character Points) on [Skill Categories]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories" >}}) and [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) .
 - [Character Sandbox](/crestfallen_sandbox.xlsx)
 - Don't have Excel? [Try 365 Online for free.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/free-office-online-for-the-web)
- Finalize your character sheet with Crestfallen Staff.

Please note that we are available to assist with Character Sheet creation during our Discord Hangouts (schedule on [CrestfallenLARP.com](https://crestfallenlarp.com/schedule/)), private discord discussions, email [Crestfallenlarp@gmail.com](mailto:Crestfallenlarp@gmail.com), or scheduled meetings. We prefer to have Character Sheets completed before events so we can focus on the event itself. 

### Lineages

In Crestfallen there are currently six different character lineages. Each of these lineages have different costume requirements for play and skills they may learn. A player should take these items into account prior to choosing a lineage to play. 

All Lineages are our own version of fantasy characters from folklore. Each Lineage group has a particular political and military point of view. It is up to the player to decide if they wish to take part in these viewpoints or distance themselves from them. The Lineages do not enforce any particular social or cultural viewpoints. Each player is allowed to determine these viewpoints without influence from the game world itself and should be based on the players own comfort level.

#### Mixed Lineage

Please note, it is acceptable for a character to be of mixed lineage, however the character may only benefit from one [Lineage Skill Category]({{< ref "/rules/lineage_skill_categories" >}}) and must follow all costume requirements matching this [Lineage Skill Category]({{< ref "/rules/lineage_skill_categories" >}}). Both Lineages must be listed on the Character Sheet for story purposes and may not be altered after character creation.

### Points Systems

#### Character Points/CP Cost

Every character in Crestfallen starts the game with 60 CP (Character Points) and gains additional through attendance. Characters use these CP to purchase [Skill Categories]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories" >}}) and [Skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}), which grant characters additional options throughout the course of the game. Characters start with access to the [General Skill Category]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories/#general-skill-category" >}}) and the characters [Lineage Skill Category]({{< ref "/rules/lineage_skill_categories" >}}) for free. Other than these, the first [Skill Category]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories" >}}) a Character purchases will cost 5 CP. Each additional Skill Category will cost 5 more than the last purchased. (1st is 5, 2nd is 10, 3rd is 15, etc). Once a [Skill Category]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories" >}}) is purchased, a Character may then purchase skills at their listed cost. Skills found on multiple lists may have different costs. The cost of a skill will always be the cost when purchased. No CP will be refunded if a [Skill Category]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories/" >}}) is later unlocked with a different cost unless stated in a particular skill.

#### Gaining CP

Characters gain 4 CP for attending an event (2CP for a One-Day). In addition, they may receive up to 4 CP bonus for the character they are playing and an additional 4 CP bonus for their secondary character (also reduced to 2 and 2 for One-Day events). These bonus CP can be gained in the following ways.

- **Preregistration** – If the site cost for an event is met before the preregistration deadline, all players who preregister for that event will be granted 1 CP. (limit 1 per event)
- **Leaves** – Turning in 100 Leaves during an event grants a player 1 CP. (limit 1 per event)
- **In Game Space** – Bringing, maintaining and allowing other players to access an In Game decorated space such as a Tavern, Lab, Workshop, Store, Library, etc will grant the player 1 CP. This area must be set up prior to game and approved by plot to receive this CP.
- **Monster NPC Shift** – A player may spend 4 hours doing an NPC shift as a side story monster. This will be 100% combat based and grant the player 1 CP.
- **NPC Additional Costuming** – A player may bring their own extra costuming and gear to make their NPC more distinct. If an NPC shows exceptional costuming, they will be granted 1 CP.
- **Roleplay NPC Shift** – On a limited basis, plot may need a particular NPC for roleplay reasons. If a player is pulled out of game to play a particular NPC for such reasons, they will be granted 1 CP. (Limit 1 per event)
- **Full NPC Shift** – A player who NPCs for a full event will be granted 4 CP as well as leaves/resources based on the current attendance policy.
- **Staff** – A player who is on staff will be granted 4 CP as well as leaves/resources based on the current attendance policy. (This may stack with Full NPC Shift)
- **Merchants** – A player who brings costuming, food, or other items for sale (Out of Game) that build the ambiance of the game world may be granted 1 CP. This may be in addition to In Game Space as well. This area should be set up prior to game and approved by plot to receive this CP. (Limit 1 per event)
- **Clean Up** – A player who goes above and beyond in assisting with cleanup during or following the event may receive 1 CP.
- **Carpool** – A player who brings 2 additional players or more may be granted 1 CP. (Limit 1 per event)
- **Purchase** – A player may purchase any additional outstanding CP at the values listed on the website at time of preregistration or registration at the door.
- **EMT/First Aid** – A player who has a first aid or EMT certificate and agrees to act in this capacity may be granted 1 CP. To receive the CP the certificate must be verified and valid during the course of the event.

#### Stamina

Every character in Crestfallen starts the game with 5 ST (Stamina) and may purchase additional ST with their CP. A Character starts every game with their max ST and may use these ST to fuel [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) according to their ST Cost. When purchasing [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) these ST Costs should be kept in mind. ST may be regained in many ways and is described in greater detail later in this document.

#### Energy

Some Character’s in Crestfallen may choose to use magic. Most of this magic is fueled by [Energy]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#energy" >}}) which may be purchased with CP in the [Magical Combat Skill Category]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories/#magical-combat-skill-category" >}}) and/or some [Lineage Skill Categories]({{< ref "/rules/lineage_skill_categories" >}}). A character starts every game with their max Energy and may use these to fuel spells according to their Energy Cost. Energy may be regained in many ways and is described in greater detail later in this document.

#### Essence

Characters in Crestfallen do not die the way that people do in real life. Each character has an amount of life energy known as Essence that they may use to return to life (or for additional uses found in game). All characters start with 5 Essence and may gain additional points on rare occasions. Occasions may include yearly rule voting meetings (open to all attendees), special events, and currency turn in.

#### Body

A character’s health is determined by the amount of Body the character has. All characters start with 5 Body and may purchase additional based on their [General Skill Category]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories/#general-skill-category" >}}) and [Lineage Skill Categories]({{< ref "/rules/lineage_skill_categories" >}}). Also, a character’s costume may add an additional 10 Body based on its rating.

Costuming that is entirely in period grants a character a maximum of 10 body . They will reduce a costume value to 5 for minimal visible anachronistic items, such as logos, cargo pants, sweatpants, modern technology, and brightly colored or clearly modern footwear. A marshal will grant 0 for costumes that are blatantly anachronistic. This is reserved for players that put forth little effort to cover or alter their regular attire such as wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a tabard. A player exhibiting poor costuming on multiple occasions may be asked to leave for detracting from the game for other players but will be warned.

#### Armor

A character may wear armor, which protects their body from harm. To use armor, the character must purchase the ability to wear armor from the [general skill category]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories/#general-skill-category" >}}) or some [lineage skill categories]({{< ref "/rules/lineage_skill_categories" >}}). A character may only use as much Armor as purchased through [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}), though they may always wear armor that is worth more points than this. Armor is important in building immersion in our imaginary world. These props grant characters armor points after they have received a rating from a marshal prior to game start. New players should email pictures of their armor to staff prior to attending an event at [Crestfallenlarp@gmail.com](mailto:Crestfallenlarp@gmail.com).

Armor grants a character a maximum of 40 armor points. There may be [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}), spells, and items that grant armor exceeding these amounts. This is allowable within the system and will be judged appropriately by the staff during check in and throughout the course of events. A character gains 5 armor by covering most of a body area with armor made of/appearing as in period materials. A marshal may decide that the armor appears too modern or harms immersion and reduce this total to 2 for the body area. Body areas are 

- Head
- Front Torso
- Back Torso
- Upper Right Arm
- Lower Right Arm
- Upper Left Arm
- Lower Left Arm
- Upper Right Leg
- Lower Right Leg
- Upper Left Leg
- Lower Left Leg

## Combat

**Melee Damage –** Melee weapons may be used by any character. If the character is not [proficient]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#proficiency" >}}), the weapon will deal 1 damage and may not benefit from any [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) that increase the damage of that weapon. If the character is [proficient]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#proficiency" >}}), a one handed weapon will deal 2 damage plus any skills that may add to the weapon. If the character is [proficient]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#proficiency" >}}), a staff will deal 2 points of damage plus any [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) that may add to the weapon. If the character is [proficient]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#proficiency" >}}), all other two handed melee weapons will deal 4 points of damage. Damage may be altered with appropriate skills and/or item tags. Brawlers and Claws are one handed boffer weapons that are green or red in color and represent natural weapons such as claws, wings, tails or fists.

**Flurry Rule -** While taking part in melee combat, a combatant may swing their weapon and call damage a maximum of three times in rapid succession before resetting. This reset must be a short pause and may include stepping back or setting up defensively. Some [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) or items may allow characters to increase the number of swings they may make during the course of a flurry. If there is ever confusion regarding this, a marshall may be contacted to ensure the rules are being followed appropriately.

**Pinning/Trapping -** A character may not trap another characters weapon against a stationary target (tree, door frame, etc.). Additionally, a character should not attempt to trap a weapon with their own weapons, shields, or costuming. These maneuvers are considered dangerous and may cause damage to the weapons themselves.

**Weapon Swings -** All weapon swings should be limited to between 45 and 90 degrees, be controlled, and at a speed to match the appropriate weapon damage call. 

**Turtling -** A character may not hide in a way where their head is the only valid target to attack. This includes hiding around doorways with no valid targets, using a shield to cover the entirety of a body, or similar tricks to prevent damage due to unsafe fighting conditions. 

**Ranged Damage –** Ranged weapons may not be used unless the character is [proficient]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#proficiency" >}}) in the weapons use. Thrown weapons will deal 1 damage plus any [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) that may add to the weapon. Bows and Crossbows will deal 2 damage plus any [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) that may add to the weapon. Damage may be altered with appropriate [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) and/or item tags. *Please note that Firearms do not follow these rules and are discussed below.*

**Firearms -** Using a firearm in Crestfallen is supposed to be difficult. The technology is new and evolving and should be roleplayed as such. A character must have [proficiency]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#proficiency" >}}) in Firearms to use any dart based weapon. Additionally, a character must over embellish the act of aiming at a target for 3 seconds before calling damage and discharging the blaster. Firearms will deal “[Unblockable]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#unblockable" >}}) 5 Damage” and may not be used with any other [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) unless specifically noted. Firearms with different damage amounts and abilities may be created using the crafting system.

**Illegal Targets –** Combat at LARP events can become frantic at times. Players should fight with as much control as possible to avoid injuring other attendees. In melee combat the head/face and groin areas are considered illegal targets. Players are not allowed to target these areas on purpose with melee, ranged, or firearm attacks. Ranged attacks that make incidental contact with these areas count, however, it should be noted that if these areas are hit on a regular basis, a characters ability to use melee or ranged combat may be removed by staff at any time.

## Magic

Magic in Crestfallen is controlled by the acquisition and use of energy. This is a generic term as the players can determine what their source of energy may be, such as

- familial bonds
- traumatic events
- rigorous study
- experimental magics or surgeries
- teacher/student relations.

The magic system always works in the following ways, regardless of how the character views magic.

### Gaining Spells

Every time a character purchases  [Energy]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#energy" >}}) with CP, they gain access to a new basic spell from the spell list. This spell is added to the spells known section of the character sheet.

### Creating New Spells

A character may create a new spell. To do so, the player contacts plot staff between events to discuss what their new spell will do, determine its energy cost, and decide if the spell will be a prototype or added directly to the rules system. A character may only have one prototype spell at a time. This spell is being tested and may only be used by that character. Prototype spells cannot be copied, turned into items, or be taught to other characters. Every year, prototype spells are reviewed and voted on by the player base to decide if they will be included to the permanent spell list, discarded, or revised for additional testing. Once a spell is approved for use, the creator is given an approved project design card. This allows the character to add the spell to their spells known, teach the spell to other characters for addition into their spells known, and grant access to the guilds to distribute the spell to other characters. 

### Casting a Spell

Before casting a spell, a character must have an open hand with a spell prop in it and enough spell energy to cast the spell. Spell energy is represented by wooden tongue depressors that are acquired from Logistics at the beginning of game or when recovered. The character then says the spells incantation, breaks the appropriate amount of energy, and either touches or throws the prop at the intended target. A spell cast via touch may be resisted by the target with the call of “[resist]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#resist" >}})”. A thrown spell that hits the target, including any items that the target was carrying or wearing at the beginning of the incantation must take the spell effect. Following this, the Energy/Spell is spent and may then be recovered. Please note, that if the incantation is not completed or said properly, then the Energy/Spell has not been spent and may be attempted again. Players may create their own spell incantations with a minimum of 5 words, but must include the spell name/effect as the last statement of the incantation.

### Recovering Energy

Once a character has used Energy through the casting of a spell, they may then take time to rest and recover the spent Energy. To do so the player must take part in a restful activity tied to their viewpoint on magic. Examples of these activities include but are not limited to the following:

- Meditation
- Study
- Reading
- Napping

A character recovers 1 Energy for every 30 minutes spent completing these activities. Items and Plot Effects may exist that increase or decrease the amount of time spent to recover Energy or increases or decreases the amount of Energy that can be recovered at one time. There are also Items that can instantly restore Energy to a Character. A Character may only benefit from these Items once per event. Recovered energy must be tracked on the character sheet and props will be supplied by logistics once completed.

## Counted Actions

Counted actions are generic actions or specific skills that take a longer amount of time to complete. Counted actions for [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) are described in their entries. Most counted actions take 3 seconds and have a specific call in order to use them. Longer counted actions may not be counted out loud or have a call, but the character completing the action must track the duration of these actions. A counted action starts at the beginning of the count and only completes when the correct call or duration has completed. If the character doing the counted action takes damage, uses a game skill, uses a game spell, uses a magic item, or loses contact with the target, the counted action does not complete. 

A counted action that harms a character, such as killing blow, is treated as an attack during the entirety of the count. As such, conditions that end on being attacked are ended during the beginning of the counted action, allowing the character to react.

Below are a list of counted actions that are not tied to specific [skills]({{< ref "/rules/skills" >}}) and that any character may do.

**Carrying -** A character or characters may carry another character by placing one hand on each arm of the target and walking with them. If two characters are carrying a target or a character with [strength]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#strength " >}}) carries a target, they may choose to run if the target is physically able and willing to do so. The call for this is “I/we carry you 1, I/we carry you 2, I/we carry you 3” before moving. While moving, if anyone taking part in this action takes damage, the target is instantly dropped.

**Forcing a door -** Two characters or a character with Strength may force a door open when being held, barricaded or locked. If a character(s) with strength attempts to move the door, characters must state the levels in Strength to determine who is stronger or compare to the barricade or lock. Treat two characters without [Strength ]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#strength " >}}) as [Strength]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#strength " >}}) 1. The character(s) attempting to force the door open must be stronger for the door to open. The call for this is “I/we force the door 1, I/we force the door 2, I/we force the door 3” while the character(s) are touching a single door.

**Holding a door –** Two characters or a character with Strength may hold a door shut. If a character(s) with strength attempts to move the door, characters must state the levels in [Strength ]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#strength " >}}) to determine who is stronger. Treat two characters without [Strength]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#strength " >}}) as [Strength]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#strength " >}}) 1. The character(s) attempting to force the door open must be stronger for the door to open. The call for this is “I/we hold the door 1, I/we hold the door 2, I/we hold the door 3” while the character(s) are touching a single door.

**Killing Blow –** A character may deal a lethal blow to a target causing them to instantly gain the [Dead Condition]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#dead" >}}). The call for this is “I kill you 1, I kill you 2, I kill you 3” while touching the characters arm or holding a weapon to the torso of the character. Firearm props should not be used for safety reasons.

**Recovery Energy -** A character may take 30 minutes to recover 1 Energy point. This time should be used for mental self-care for the player such resting, reading, meditating, or similar activities. This duration may be changed due to plot effects, items, or other game effects and should be tracked appropriately. Players who endanger themselves or others by not taking proper care of themselves or by preventing others from doing so may be asked to not attend future events.

**Recovery Stamina –** A character may take 30 minutes to recover 1 ST point. This time should be used for self-care for the player such as eating, hydrating, and resting. This duration may be changed due to plot effects, items, or other game effects and should be tracked appropriately. Players who endanger themselves or others by not taking proper care of themselves or by preventing others from doing so may be asked to not attend future events.

**Restraining –** A character may use rope/chain to restrain a character. The target gains any of the [Entangled Conditions]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#entangled" >}}) and can be moved using the carrying action described in this section. This restraint should be roleplayed only. No physical bond should be in use for players safety. The target should carry the binding rope/chain with them to represent the restraint. The call for this is “I restrain you 1, I restrain you 2, I restrain you 3”

**Search –** A character may be searched for any leaves they may have on their person. The call for this is “I search you 1, I search you 2, I search you 3” while touching the targets arm.

**Search (known item) –** A character may be searched for an item that they are known or be suspected of having on their person. The call for this is “I search you for [described item] 1, I search you for [described item] 2, I search you for [described item] 3” while touching the targets arm. A character may ask for a clarification regarding the search but should not try to actively deceive another player to prevent the item from being found. Players found to do this are in violation of the Sportsmanship policy and [Code of Conduct]({{< ref "#code-of-conduct" >}}) and may be asked not to attend future events. A character may use the Sense ability to pinpoint specific items for use in this search.

### Limited Counted Actions

Limited Counted Actions follow the same rules as counted actions but are usually completed by NPCs or must be prompted by a plot member for a Character to use.

**Module Specified** – This counted action will be specific to the module and described prior to the module or will be negotiated with the marshal during the module. All information such as calls or duration will be discussed at that time.

**Transportation (Teleportation)** – This counted action simulates magical transportation such as portals and Teleportation. The call for this is “I vanish 1, I vanish 2, I vanish 3” followed by “I appear 1, I appear 2, I appear 3” after arriving at the appropriate spot. Characters are considered spirits during all Teleportation.

## Currency

**Leaves –** These are the main money source within Crestfallen. Leaves were originally created through an Alchemical and Enchantment technique that solidified Essence inside of a trees leaves. This made them highly sought after. 100 leaves may be turned in during the course of an event to gain 1 bonus CP or 500 leaves may be turning in once a year to gain 1 bonus Essence. Please note that players are restricted to how many bonus CP they may gain during the course of an event.

**Resources –** These are in game items that allow characters to build tagged items, develop new designs, and maintain tagged items that are starting to deteriorate. Get them either through gathering, harvesting, or they can be found as treasure. The basic crafting resources can be used in any of the crafting types interchangeably. These are common components. Used to make whatever your whatever you are creating according to the recipe. 

- basic - A specific type of basic component used in many recipes. Interchangeable. 
- common
- rare - rare components or the ones that are very very specific. 

**Essence -** This is the amount of life force found within the character at the time. This can be used to survive a character death, help bring another character back to life, fuel magic in unexpected ways, to infuse crafted items and more.

**Time** - Time is a vital resource that is not tracked the same way that Leaves, Resources, and Essence are. Counted actions that restore Stamina and Energy or the Gathering and Crafting skills all have a component based on time. It is important that players keep these mechanics in mind. We are currently not strict in the tracking of time on sheets for these uses. If a player sits and has a conversation that has lasted a half hour, they may count this as resting to restore Stamina or Energy (even if this was not the original intent). These items may be tracked more in future if cheating or abuse is noticed.

## Research

Research is a valuable portion of our game as it allows characters to figure out story beats and world lore on the players terms rather than plots. This makes the skills difficult to manage at times. To make things easier, we have formulated the following system.

1. **Pre-Event Questions –** A character may ask 1 question per research skill on their sheet. These questions must be turned in at least 2 weeks prior to an event. Each question will be treated as the character has been spending off time researching the specifics of the question. Each question will receive a response of at least 1 sentence to a maximum of 1 page depending on time available prior to the event.

2. **During Event Questions –** A character may ask 3 Yes or No questions based on the specific research type and as it relates to the current event. These Yes or No questions are based on plot as it is progressing, and not necessarily cannon for overarching plot. These skills should help guide players in decisions but are not intended to give large amounts of information during the course of the event.

3. **During Event Crafting Assistance –** A character may use a research skill to help determine what resource costs and effects may occur in creating a design prior to its actual construction. This helps to reduce failures and unforeseen negatives that may occur.

## Crafting, Science, & Technology

Crafting items in Crestfallen have four levels
- Basic
- Augmentation
- Mastery
- Technology.

### Basic Build items and uses

All basic build items last for the duration of the event, until used, or until [destroyed]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#destroyed" >}}). A [Break]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#broken-break" >}}) effect will destroy a basic build item. These items are marked on the character sheet and cannot be traded between characters after creation. All Basic Build items require an appropriate prop in their description. This item is required to use the effect of a Basic Build Item. One Basic Crafting Component and 30 minutes of acting out the brewing, building, or enchanting creates 5 items or the Craft effect from one appropriate craft.

#### Alchemy Basic Build Items

- **Alchemical Grenade**: Spell Ammo - A character may throw a ranged attack with the verbal of “5 [damage]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#damage" >}})”.
- **Alchemical Flashbang**: Spell Ammo - A character may throw a ranged attack with the verbal of “[Knockback]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#knockback" >}})”.
- **Tangle Bag**: Spell Ammo – A character may throw a ranged attack with the verbal of “[Entangle]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#entangled" >}}) Foot”
- **Alcohol**: Potion Bottle – A character may drink or grant another a drink that grants the [Distracted]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#distracted" >}}) effect.
- *Craft Effect* **Weapon Poison +1:** Purple Ribbon – A character may deal 1 additional point of damage with a weapon that has the craft effect until the item is [broken]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#broken-break" >}}) or [destroyed]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#destroyed" >}}). This may not be used on Firearms.

#### Enchanting Basic Build Items

- **Healing Potion**: Potion Bottle - A character may drink or be fed this potion with the verbal of “5 [healing]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#healing" >}})”.
- **Heartiness Potion**: Potion Bottle – A character may drink or be fed this potion with the verbal of “5 Body” This potion grants 5 additional Body points which are lost before costuming and normal Body points. A character may only have additional Body points from one source at a time. The highest value will take precedence.
- **Enchanted Armor Wand**: Wand Prop and Spell Ammo – A character may touch Spell Ammo to a Wand Prop while using the verbal “5 Enchanted Armor”. The caster may then snap the Wand Prop and throw or touch the Spell Ammo to a target. This grants the target 5 additional Armor points if they are already wearing armor. They may use these additional points over the maximum amount granted by the Wear Armor skill. A character may only have additional Armor points from one source at a time. The highest value will take precedence.
- **Mana Potion**: Potion Bottle - A character may drink or be fed this potion with the verbal of “1 Energy”. This potion grants 1 Energy to the character who drinks it. A character may only drink 5 Mana Potions per event.
- *Craft Effect* **Rune of Protection**: Wearable Rune – A character may wear one Rune of Protection at any given time. The first spell that hits a character wearing a Rune of Protection, is negated with the call of “[resist]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#resist" >}})”. This “[resist]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#resist" >}})” must be used, regardless of the spell being thrown. A spell that is cast via touch does not trigger this “[resist]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#resist" >}})”.

#### Forging Basic Build Items

- **One Handed Weapon**: One Handed Weapon under 46” (116.84 Cm) - A character may use any One Handed Weapon that fits the appropriate size and safety requirements. These weapons are put on to the character sheet and are destroyed with a [Break]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#broken-break" >}}) or [Destroy Condition]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#destroyed" >}}).

- **Two Handed Weapons**: Two Handed Weapon 46.1” to 75” (190.5 Cm) - A character may use any Two Handed Weapon that fits the appropriate size and safety requirements. These weapons are put on to the character sheet and are destroyed with a [Break]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#broken-break" >}}) or [Destroy Condition]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#destroyed" >}}).

- **Ranged Weapon**: Any Thrown Weapon (Small/Coreless), Crossbow Min/Max Dimension 12”/24” (30.48Cm/60.96 Cm) or Bow Min/Max Length 34”/44” (86.36Cm/111.76Cm) - A character may use any Ranged Weapon that fits the appropriate size and safety requirements. These weapons are put on to the character sheet, and are destroyed with a [Break]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#broken-break" >}}) or [Destroy Condition]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#destroyed" >}}).

- **Shield and/or Buckler Shield**: Shield Maximum 36” (91.44 Cm) Tall at longest dimension. Maximum 24” (60.96 Cm) Wide at longest dimension shield. Buckler Maximum 20” diameter. May Hold or Strap to Arm - A character may use any Shield that fits the appropriate size and safety requirements. These shields are put on to the character sheet and are destroyed with a [Break]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#broken-break" >}}) or [Destroy Condition]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#destroyed" >}}).

- **Armor**: Prop Evaluated By Staff - A character may use any Armor that fits the appropriate size and safety requirements. This armor is put on to the character sheet and is destroyed with a [Break]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#broken-break" >}}) or [Destroy Condition]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#destroyed" >}}).

- *Craft Effect* **Repair Item**: A tagged Item and prop – A character may repair a [broken]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#broken-break" >}}) item, allowing it to be used once more. To repair a tagged item, the crafter must put their character number on the durability box to show that it has been repaired.

### Crafting: Augmentation

An Augmentation item is a tagged item with a set durability and different game effects. To craft an Augmented Item, a character must either have an Approved Project Design Card OR they must create one. The creation of an Approved Project Design Card takes time based on the items complexity. Crafters should discuss their plans with Plot prior to events, and attempts will be tracked on character sheets for open transparency between plot and players. Players may use their Research skills and other resources to attempt to speed up the production of a Design Card. Plot may ask for a character to Playtest a design prior to approval. Final approval for Playtest Design Cards will go to the Player Base Votes at the end of each season.

If the character has the appropriate skills and an Approved Project Design Card, they may spend the resources listed on the card and 30 minutes of acting out the brewing, building, or enchanting to create the item.

All Augmented Items will have the following standardized limiting rules.

- Durability starts at 1 and may be no more than 16.
- Charged items use 1 durability per use.
- Items granting bonuses to damage may not exceed +1
- Items dealing spell damage or healing may not exceed 20 points
- Items will have a set resource cost in Basic and Common Resources only
- Rare resources may be used but will have no additional effect items.

### Crafting: Mastery

Mastery items are also tagged items but have different restrictions and more game effects possible. An Approved Project Design Card is still required to create a Mastery item and follow all the other rules set forth in the Augmentation section.

If the character has the appropriate skills and an Approved Project Design Card, they may spend the resources listed on the card and 30 minutes of acting out the brewing, building, or enchanting to create the item.

All Mastery Items will have the following standardized limiting rules.

- Durability starts at 1 and may be increased to 32.
- Unlimited Durability items are possible to craft at this level.
- Items granting bonuses to damage may not exceed +3
- Items dealing spell damage or healing may not exceed 60 points
- Items will have a set resource cost in Basic, Common, and/or Rare Resources
- Additional currency or resources may be required
- Additional currency or resources may be used to modify effects during creation based on the resources and plot based effects (percentile role for possible effects)

### Crafting: Technology

Technology items are the combination of two or more Crafting Skills with additional input from other skills within the game. These tagged items are wild and varied and will always require a Playtest period as described in the Crafting: Augmentation section.

If the character(s) has(have) the appropriate skills and an Approved Project Design Card, they may spend the resources listed on the card and 30 minutes of acting out the brewing, building, or enchanting to create the item.

All Technology items will have the following standardized limiting rules.

- Durability starts at 1 and may be increased to 32.
- Technology items may never be made with Unlimited Durability.
- Items granting bonuses to damage may not exceed +6
- Items dealing spell damage or healing may not exceed 100 points
- Items will have a set resource cost in Basic, Common, and/or Rare Resources
- Additional currency or resources may be required
- Chance of failure or unforeseen outcomes and plot based effects will occur (percentile role for possible effects)

## Medical Training and Surgery

**Roleplay –** While magic exists, it is often very specific and heavily rationed. With large battles and many characters being wounded and under the effects of varying conditions, it makes sense that trained medical professions are still required and sometimes preferred. Characters trained in the Medical Training and Surgery skills should roleplay their abilities such as bandaging wounds, making sutures, resetting bones, applying salves/ointments, etc.

**Experimental Surgery –** The basic Surgery skill allows a character to be healed of multiple conditions and damage very quickly, but with a risk. Experimental Surgery is much more challenging and open ended. Experimental Surgery is handled similar to the crafting of items. A character must either have an Approved Project Design Card OR they must create one for Experimental Surgery. The creation of an Approved Project Design Card takes time based on the complexity of the Surgery. Surgeons should discuss their plans with Plot prior to events, and attempts will be tracked on character sheets for open transparency between plot and players. Players may use their Research skills and other resources to attempt to speed up the production of a Design Card. Plot may ask for a character to Playtest a design prior to approval. Final approval for Playtest Design Cards will go to the Player Base Votes at the end of each season.

If the character has the appropriate skills and an Approved Project Design Card, they may spend the resources listed on the card and 30 minutes of acting out completing the surgery on a target to grant the effect. The effect lasts until the limb that was targeted by the surgery is [destroyed]({{< ref "/rules/conditions/#destroyed" >}}) or the character dies.

Completing either form of Surgery requires a percentile dice role on the Surgery chart to determine its success. The chart is based on the overall danger level for the event (which can be found on the schedule page of the website or during check-in).

## Guilds and Governments

Guilds and Governments are used to assist characters in their roleplay, resource management, and organization within the game. A Guild is a business tied to a skill found in the more roleplay intensive [skill categories]({{< ref "/rules/skill_categories" >}}). These businesses include the Craft, Merchants, Research and Thieves Guilds. The only requirement to join a Guild is taking its appropriate skill. A Government is an organization run by the ruling members of a particular Lineage. The only requirement to join a Government is to be a member of that particular Lineage.

Other than the requirements for entry, Guilds and Governments function in a similar fashion. Each organization will have a folder found in the town hub. If a character meets the membership requirements, they will be allowed to have access to this folder. Characters may be members in multiple organizations, however, they may be limited on how far they may advance within multiple organizations. It should also be noted that advancement within an organization will NEVER give a character power over another character.

### Organization Folders 

Organization folders will have the following items within them to help players interact with the gameworld and plot.

#### Module List 

Each organization will have several jobs or modules that they would like their members to complete throughout the course of an event. Many of these will be at set times of the day and characters may sign up for them on the module list found within.

#### Market Value Chart

Each organization has a chart of items they are selling, as well as looking to purchase. This list may change from event to event. Only members of the appropriate organization may see this chart, unless the character has an additional skill (such as [Going Rate]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#going-rate" >}})) that grants access. This is a great way to stockpile some items or to make a profit selling items to the organization.

#### Rumors List

The organization has its own interests and NPCs. As such, they may have information regarding current events, locations, monsters, and other rumors that may or may not be true. These rumors may give insight on what may go on during an event, tips on items that may sell well or be bought cheap in the future.

#### Guild Features

(Guilds only) Each guild has a way of making money for their organization in addition to the buying and selling of items and sending members on missions.

##### Craft Guild 

###### Project Library

The Craft Guild maintains the Project Library which houses all publicly available Approved Project Designs. When a member of the Craft Guild develops an Approved Project Design, they may sell the rights of the design to the guild. The guild will buy designs that use Basic and Common resources for 10 leaves and designs that use Rare resources for 20 leaves. Additionally, the guild will rent out designs in the Project Library for 5 leaves for Basic and Common resource designs and 10 leaves for rare resource designs. Advancement in the guild will grant members reduced costs on these rental rates. These amounts may change, but will be detailed in the Craft Guild folder.

##### Merchants Guild

###### The Bank

The Merchants Guild maintains the Bank. Characters can store their leaves in the Bank to ensure its safety. In addition to this service, the Bank offers loans to characters. The bank will loan leaves in increments of 10 at the rate of 1 leaf interest per event. (example: Your character borrows 30 leaves from the bank. If you pay this loan back during the same event, you must repay 33 leaves. If you repay the following event, you must repay 36 leaves....39...42...45, etc.) If a character ever reaches an amount owed of two times what was borrowed, the character may be put up for bounty to the Thieves Guild. These amounts may change, but will be detailed in the Merchants Guild folder. 

##### Research Guild

###### Research Library

The Research Guild maintains the Research Library which houses all publicly available Research Documents granted via the Research Skills as well as Plot In Game Documents and Character created documents. Some documents found in this Library are confirmed to be accurate with the game world by the plot staff and will be clearly marked as such. Characters may submit documentation to the Research Library for payment as well as possible advancement with the guild. Researchers will be paid 2 leaves per page (8.5x11 paper, double spaced, 12 font standard) submitted. This price will be doubled for any document that is verified as accurate from plot prior to submission. The Research Library may be rented at 5 leaves per hour, with the rental cost being reduced by guild membership and rank within the guild.

##### Thieves Guild 

###### The Stockpile 

The Thieves Guild is in charge of handling the Stockpile which houses emergency Resources and items. The Stockpile has different items, availability, and rates depending on the skills and/or rank within the guild. Additionally, members may donate or sell items to the Stockpile in order to advance within the guild. Rare Resources will **NEVER** be sold by plot unless they are found here.

###### Bounties 

Bounties are also handled by the Thieves Guild. These are contracts against player characters who have either failed to repay their debts to the Merchants Guild or broke an In Game Law (see [The Laws Of The Inspired Of Katalossa]({{< ref "#the-laws-of-the-inspired-of-katalossa" >}}) for more details). These bounties are always optional to players (No PVP will intentionally be forced). These bounties are always structured in order to repay the characters debt and to prevent grief to the character at all costs. A member of the Thieves Guild will be authorized to subdue (never kill) the target character and retrieve the amount of leaves owed on the characters debt or a specific fine amount from their person. This amount is then returned to the Thieves Guild. The member may not keep any additional money from this bounty, otherwise they may lose access to the Bounty system and may lose status within the guild. A character will always be notified that a bounty is active against them prior to the bounty being available to members of the guild.

### Guild Advancement

Character advancement within each organization is based on donations and modules completed. Every 10 leaves, 10 resources, 5 items or 1 module brought to a satisfactory completion will grant a character 1 point within the guild. 

| Points | Guild ranks  | Government ranks |
| ------ | ------------- | ---------------- |
| 0   | Apprentice  | Citizen     |
| 10   | Journeyperson | Councilperson  |
| 30   | Master    | Lord/Lady    |
| 60   | Grand Master | Chancellor    |

These ranks do not confirm any powers of law or justice to the character, but instead shows their influence with the particular organization and its NPCS. Holding a higher title may grant the character more Roleplay with NPCs and grant the characters some sway with the organization as a whole. Additionally, these titles may grant additional voting ability to direct how an organization may proceed.
