## Battle 

**Duration**: While combat is ongoing or for 1 minute of downtime following – 

**Valid Targets**: Creatures/Characters

A battle occurs when 2 or more Creatures/Characters are attacking each other. Some skills use the end of a battle as a condition for the skill to end. A Creature/Character is not allowed to hide at the edge of a fight to end such a skill on themselves. This is expressly forbidden. A Battle ends for a character if they gain the Spirit condition, combat ends with at least 1 minute of downtime for all participants, or after being out of sight and range of the battle for 1 minute. 

## Berserk

**Duration**: Until Removed or End of Battle

**Valid Targets**: Creature/Character

The target becomes enraged beyond control and attempts to kill all characters near them, starting with what they consider to be the closest, regardless of line of sight. The character must deal the maximum damage with all weapon swings, ranged attacks and spell damage. This does not force the character to use any ST or Energy based skills.

## Bleed

**Duration**: Until Removed

**Valid Targets**: Creature/Character 

The target is bleeding constantly and cannot benefit from any type of healing effect. This includes all effects that heal damage, bring characters back to life after becoming  [Dead]({{< ref "#dead" >}}), and effects that extend death and dying counts.

## Broken (Break) 

**Duration**: Until Repaired

**Valid Targets**: Weapon, Shield, Armor, Limb, Tagged Items 

The target is broken and must be repaired before it can be used properly. 

- Weapons that gain this condition may only deal 1 point of damage. 
- Shields that gain this condition do not fully protect its owner, dealing 1 point of damage to its wielder every time it is struck. Additionally, a broken shield will not protect its wielder from a condition attack such as  [Waylay]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#waylay" >}}).. 
- Armor that gains this condition loses all Armor points until repaired. Limbs that are broken may not be used (No hopping while in combat for player safety please). 
- Claws and Limbs that are broken may be fixed by [Medical Training Augmentation#]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#medical-training-augmentation" >}}). 
- Any other item that gains this condition is not usable. Items can be repaired to remove this condition using the appropriate crafting skill.

All tagged items lose one durability when repaired from the Broken condition.

## Charmed 

**Duration**: Until Removed, Attacked by the caster

**Valid Targets**: Creature/Character 

The target views the character that charmed them as their best friend. This target will listen and follow most suggestions, if they are things the character would normally do for a friend such as protect them, share information with them, lend basic items, and attack hostile creatures if they are unknown to the target. This will not force the target to go against their normal behaviors including breaking laws, killing friends, giving away all of their items, allowing themselves to be defenseless, or killing themselves. The Charmed target does not remember being Charmed after the duration ends or when it is removed.

## Cower 

**Duration**: Until Removed by standing, Being Attacked, Target Attacks or 5 minutes

**Valid Targets**:  Creature/Character

The target of the Cower effect must fall prone or drop to one knee. During this time the target may call "Cower". All intelligent creatures view the cowering target as harmless and will not attack them. Primal creatures (animals) and unintelligent creatures (undead) may disregard the Cower condition at the discretion of Plot. Characters with the [Deduction]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#deduction" >}}) skill may also use it to ignore the Cower condition.

## Dazed 

**Duration**: Until Removed, Attacked, or 5 minutes

If the target is attacked, they instantly remember everything that has occurred during the condition, including the character that put the condition on them if seen or heard. If the condition lasts the full 5 minutes, the target believes that nothing is wrong and tries to go back to what they were doing, assuming that they were sleepy or zoned out for a moment. There is no way to regain memories once the 5 minutes has been completed.

## Dead 

**Duration**: Until Removed or 5 Minutes

**Valid Targets**: Creature/Character 

The target of this condition is lifeless and retains no sensory knowledge of anything. When a target gains this condition, all active spells on the target end, though conditions such as bleed remain.

The target does not see anything unless it is about the character or others taking part in the conversation.

## Dominate 

**Duration**: Until Removed

The target views the character that dominated them as their best friend. This target will listen and follow all suggestions and orders. This will not change the targets normal tendencies or tactics, unless specifically ordered to do so. The target can be ordered to do anything; HOWEVER, this does not give the player who used the dominate condition the right to be offensive or hateful. If at any point any player is uncomfortable with how an interaction is going Out of Game, a “Check” should be called, and a staff member contacted at once for everybody's safety.

## Dying 

**Duration**: 1 Minute, Until Stabilized, or Until Healed

**Valid Targets**: Creature/Character

The target of this condition is on the verge of death and retains no sensory knowledge of anything.

If a character starts using the stabilize portion of the [Medical Training#]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#medical-training" >}}) skill on the target, the dying count freezes at its current number. If stabilize is completed, the target loses the dying condition and gains the [unconscious]({{< ref "#unconscious" >}}) condition with 1 HP.
