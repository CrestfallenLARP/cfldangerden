## Area 

**Duration**: Instantaneous 

**Valid Targets**: Defined Prop, Physical Structure

The target of this condition must take the effect of any damage or condition attached to it when touching or within the defined area during any part of the call. 

## Battle 

**Duration**: While combat is ongoing or for 1 minute of downtime following.  A battle ends for a character if they gain the spirit condition, combat ends with at least 1 minute of downtime for all participants, or after being out of sight and range of the battle for 1 minute.  A character that is being guarded or carried off by a hostile creature is still considered in battle for the purposes of conditions that end following a battle.

**Valid Targets**: Characters, Creatures 

A battle occurs when 2 or more characters or creatures are attacking each other. Some skills use the end of a battle as a condition for the skill to end.  A Character or Creature is not allowed to hide at the edge of a fight to end such a skill on themselves.

## Berserk

**Duration**: Until Removed or End of Battle

**Valid Targets**: Character, Creature

The target becomes enraged beyond control and attempts to kill all characters and creatures near them, starting with what they consider to be the closest, regardless of line of sight. The character must deal the maximum damage with all attacks and spell damage. This does not force the character to use any ST or energy based skills.

## Bleed

**Duration**: Until Removed

**Valid Targets**: Character, Creature

The target is bleeding constantly and cannot benefit from any type of healing effect. This includes all effects that heal damage, bring characters back to life after becoming [dead]({{< ref "#dead" >}}), and effects that extend death and dying counts.

## Broken (Break) 

**Duration**: Until Repaired

**Valid Targets**: Armor, Claw, Item, Limb, Shield, Weapon 

The target is broken and must be repaired before it can be used properly. 

- Weapons that gain this condition may only deal 1 point of damage. 
- Shields that gain this condition do not fully protect its owner, dealing 1 point of damage to its wielder every time it is struck. Additionally, a broken shield will not protect its wielder from a condition attack such as [waylay]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#waylay" >}}).
- Armor that gains this condition loses all armor points until repaired. 
- Limbs that are broken may not be used (No hopping while in combat for player safety please). 
- Claws and limbs that are broken may be fixed by [medical training augmentation#]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#medical-training-augmentation" >}}). 
- Any other item that gains this condition is not usable. Items can be repaired to remove this condition using the appropriate crafting skill. Basic items that become broken are [destroyed]({{< ref "#destroyed" >}}) at the end of a [battle]({{< ref "#battle" >}}). All tagged items lose one durability when repaired from the broken condition.

## Charmed 

**Duration**: Until Removed, Attacked by the caster

**Valid Targets**: Character, Creature

The target views the character that charmed them as their best friend. This target will listen and follow most suggestions, if they are things the character would normally do for a friend such as protect them, share information with them, lend basic items, and attack hostile creatures if they are unknown to the target. This will not force the target to go against their normal behaviors including breaking laws, killing friends, giving away all of their items, allowing themselves to be defenseless, or killing themselves. The charmed target does not remember being charmed after the duration ends or when it is removed.

## Cower 

**Duration**: Until Removed by standing, Being Attacked, Target Attacks or 5 minutes

**Valid Targets**:  Character, Creature

The target must fall prone or drop to one knee. During this time the target may call "cower". All intelligent creatures view the cowering target as harmless and will not attack them. Primal creatures (animals) and unintelligent creatures (most undead) may disregard the cower condition at the discretion of plot. Characters with the [deduction]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#deduction" >}}) skill may also use it to ignore the cower condition. 

## Damage 

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Valid Targets**: Character, Creature

The target of this conditions takes the amount of damage said along with it. Taking damage should be acted out.  If a player takes enough damage to lose all armor and body points, they gain the dying condition.

## Dazed 

**Duration**: Until Removed, Attacked, or 5 minutes

**Valid Targets**: Character, Creature 

The target stares off into space, not noticing or remembering anything that happens during the duration of the condition. If the target is attacked, they instantly remember everything that has occurred during the condition, including the character that put the condition on them if seen or heard. If the condition lasts the full 5 minutes, the target believes that nothing is wrong and tries to go back to what they were doing, assuming that they were sleepy or zoned out for a moment. There is no way to regain memories once the 5 minutes has been completed.

## Dead 

**Duration**: Until Removed or 5 Minutes

**Valid Targets**: Character, Creature 

The target of this condition is lifeless and retains no sensory knowledge of anything. When a target gains this condition, all active spells end with the exception of bleed.  The target will remain motionless and silent during this condition unless specifically asked questions by other characters using game skills such as medical training. If the target retains the dead condition for 5 minutes, then the target loses 1 essence point, the body vanishes, and gains the spirit condition.  All in game and out of game items are retained by the player.

## Destroyed 

**Duration**: Permanent

**Valid Targets**: Armor, Claw, Item, Limb, Shield, Weapon

The target item is destroyed and cannot be repaired. If the target is a basic item, it should be removed from the character sheet as soon as possible. If the target item is a common or rare craft item, then all durability must be removed from the tag, but it may be fixed with the [maintenance#]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#maintenance" >}}) skill or rebuilt with its full craft cost.  Claws and Limbs targeted with this condition are treated as if they have the [borken]({{< ref "#broken-break" >}}) condition and may be fixed by medical training augmentation#. (No hopping while in combat for player safety please).

## Distracted 

**Duration**: Until Removed, Being Attacked, or Effect Ends

**Valid Targets**: Character, Creature

The target of this condition is distracted by the character or creature that used the ability. While that character is speaking with the target or keeping their attention, the target must only pay attention to the distraction. The target does not hear other people talking unless they are part of the conversation/act. The target does not see anything unless it is about the character or others taking part in the conversation.

## Dominate 

**Duration**: Until Removed

**Valid Targets**: Character, Creature

The target views the character that dominated them as their best friend. This target will listen and follow all suggestions and orders. This will not change the targets normal tendencies or tactics, unless specifically ordered to do so. The target can be ordered to do anything; however, this does not give the player who used the dominate condition the right to be offensive or hateful. If at any point any player is uncomfortable with how an interaction is going out of game, a “pause” should be called, and a staff member contacted at once for everybody's safety.

## Dying 

**Duration**: 1 Minute, Until Stabilized, or Until Healed

**Valid Targets**: Character, Creature

The target of this condition is on the verge of death and retains no sensory knowledge of anything.  While in this condition a player will act out being wounded.  Examples include groaning, making quiet statements, and subtle movements.  The player cannot move from where they are located, but are allowed to reposition themselves as they are dying.  One minute after entering the dying condition, the target dies (gaining the [dead]({{< ref "#dead" >}}) condition and losing the dying condition). If a character starts using the [medical training#]({{< ref "/rules/skills/#medical-training" >}}) skill on the target, the dying count freezes at its current number. If target is stabilized, it loses the dying condition and gains the [unconscious]({{< ref "#unconscious" >}}) condition with 1 body. If the target is healed, they lose the dying condition immediately and are conscious.

## Elemental (Fire, Ice, Stone, Lightning) 

**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Valid Targets**: Character, Creature

## Entangled 

**Duration**: Until Removed

**Valid Targets**: Arms, Body, Feet of Character or Creature

A character or creature with entangled feet cannot walk, run, or move in any way from where they are currently positioned. A character or creature with Entangled arms cannot move their arms and cannot attack with them, but do not have to drop what they are currently holding and may walk/run.

While under the effects the target should attempt to remove themselves from visual range of the character or creature that used the ability.

A character who has transitioned into a spirit from having the [dead]({{< ref "#dead" >}}) condition must walk directly to a resurrection point to determine their characters fate.
