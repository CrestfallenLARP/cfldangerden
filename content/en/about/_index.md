Welcome to the Crestfallen LARP and thank you for trying our game. 
The basic premise of Crestfallen is an easy to play fantasy game system with an in-depth story and community. Character skills are basic, however their use within the game and roleplay associated with them are open to the players imagination. With the addition of open-ended crafting and research systems, as well as a continually growing game world driven by players thoughts and characters actions, we hope to build a supportive community of like-minded gamers who are here for the same reasons we are: A fun time, a good story, and a chance to be involved in something much bigger than ourselves.
