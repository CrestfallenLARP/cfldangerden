**Constructive Criticism**

Previously I wrote about some concerns regarding ownership of phys reps and protecting personal property at LARP events. In the article Personal Property, Real World Money, and More, I made the statement that LARP money is essential for building an economy. This statement is the norm, but it isn’t 100% accurate. I received the following messages regarding the article.

A gold coin was defined as the minimum amount of money needed to move plot. So a character might owe a gold coin, or could spend a gold coin or two to fuel an ability or gain an item. There were also silver coins and pocket change and those were used for roleplaying purposes only. Want to have a low-stakes poker game? Use pocket change. Want a high-stakes game, buy in is a gold coin.

Michael’s first comment describes a number of different types of economic systems that do not require phys-reps as well as LARPs without economic systems. These are all totally valid points and depend on the story the LARP is trying to tell and style of play written by the rules. This will be discussed further in the next section.

Michael’s second comment discusses physical money but in a more abstract way. This will be tackled at the end. Lets get to it!

**LARP Economics – Serious Or Just A Game**

A number of LARPs don’t use economic systems. These are usually more of the story and combat based LARPs. Events such as Renaissance Fairs, Reenactments, and war games don’t usually have tagged items to purchase or much use for imaginary currency.

Most games that have an economic systems have at least some of the following.

- Physical In Game Money or Alternative Monetary System
- In Game Items (usually tags) To Purchase
- Game Determined Skills/Abilities That Require Money
- Trading Of In Game Or Out Of Game Items
- Trade Goods (Gems, Trade Bars, Crafting Components)
- Skill/Abilities In Game To Acquire Money

Economic systems can vary in intricacy depending on the needs of the LARP system and the writers real world knowledge. Additionally money systems may include the following (including physical and accounting systems).

- Multiple Coin System (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Copper, etc) – Supplied By LARP
- Single Coin System – Supplied by LARP
- Single Coin System – Supplied by Attendee (All coins have a set value through rules or player decision)
- Paper Money System (Printed Bills) – Supplied by LARP
- Accounting System (Bank System) – Organized by LARP
- IOU System (Paper Checks, Writs of Ownership, etc) – Organized by LARP or Attendees
- Barter System – Organized by LARP or Attendees

**Why Have An Economy?**

LARPs generally have an economy as another way for attendees to feel that they are advancing throughout the course of an event. Most LARPs judge growth by skills, experience points, story beats, physical ability, influence, notoriety, power, equipment and treasure. Not all players find enjoyment from the same types of growth. Due to this, most LARPs find having some sort of economic system helps to keep lots of different types of people interested.

In addition to giving a sense of growth, economic systems are very helpful to add skills/abilities for attendees that dislike or must avoid combat. Some LARPs are built to empower its attendees to dictate the economy, while other LARPs build the economy on their own.

The most common viewpoint regarding LARP economics is that treasure is a common and vital aspect of almost all Role-Playing Games and it translates directly into LARPs. Attendees want to get something for their trouble, trade things between players, and/or buy a drink at the bar. The system doesn’t need to be overly detailed, but having something to trade back and forth adds a fun and traditional feel to any LARP.

Additionally, what kind of economy do you like for a game? Super detailed? Open ended? Physical money? Banks?
