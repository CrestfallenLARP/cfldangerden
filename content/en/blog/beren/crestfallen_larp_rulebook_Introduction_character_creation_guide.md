# **<u>Crestfallen LARP Rulebook Introduction</u>**

Hello and welcome to Crestfallen LARP!  Writing a rulebook is difficult because people learn in multiple different ways.  People can be categorized into many different learning styles such as visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinaesthetic (learning by doing).  Each person will take the rulebook and use it in their own way.  This intro is intended to give some guidance as to what LARP is, how Crestfallen LARP is intended to be portrayed, the goals of the book, and suggestions on ways to approach making a character with the book.

We hope to make it easy to jump in and play Crestfallen LARP.  Our members are available to help make you feel comfortable about your choices and assist you along the way.  Feel free to use our resources such as Website, Email, and Social Media at any time.

Now, lets go!



## **What is LARP**

LARP stands for Live Action Role Play(ing).  The short explanation of this is acting with other people in public.  The thought of this can be scary to some people, but this book is here to tell you that it can be lots of fun and very rewarding.  In a LARP environment that we are discussing there are number of things to keep in mind.

* The LARP game defines the world that all characters interact with.
* The rules define what players can/can't do and explains how the game works.
* The players determine what they want their characters want to do and use the game rules and their acting to do these actions.
* The player is only in charge of their character.

For more information on what LARP is or can be, feel free to check out the What is LARP article on the Crestfallen LARP website.



## What is Crestfallen LARP: (Beren's Hopes)

Crestfallen LARP is intended to be a frontier fantasy LARP game.  The intent is to have a feeling of exploring the game world, building a community, fighting the dangers of the wilds, making magical and scientific discoveries, recovering resources, crafting fantastical equipment, and possible danger around every corner.  The rules are intended to be simple to pick up for new players but nuanced for those that wish to delve into them.  We want to cultivate a culture of teamwork between combat and non-combat characters and growing together as a community both in and out of game.  While player versus player conflict is allowed, the laws in game are always maintained by the plot staff.  Every player has their own abilities to make decisions and act on them without other players having power over another.  A character MAY attempt to order, force, or lie to another character to do what they want, but no player character will ever be granted authority over another characters actions.



## Goals of this Book

This rulebook attempts to accomplish the following goals

* Clearly state the Code of Conduct that all Crestfallen LARP players are expected to follow
* Explain the core concepts of the Crestfallen LARP rules.
* Explain ways to make a Character so an Attendee can participate in a Crestfallen Event
* Describe the core story and lineage information of the world of Katalossa
* Act as a resource for clarifications on the Crestfallen LARP rules during gameplay.



## Disclaimer

We understand that learning the entire rulebook is difficult and mistakes will happen.  While we want everyone to understand all of the rules as much as possible, we have a very friendly and understanding community.  We want to lift each other up.

Players should review the Code of Conduct and Philosophies first, as these impact the safety and expectations of all attendees.  After this, the player should learn the rules systems that they will be interacting with most as their character.  Next, the conditions and combat sections will be important to know for character survival. Finally, the players should review any rules they have skipped as they may be useful to know later on.



## Parts of a Character

A playerâ€™s character (PC for short) is how they interact with the game world and is broken into the following parts

* Backstory: This is the PC's history before coming to an event.  This can include a number of items such as previous schooling, occupation, family, home town, minor/major events, etc.
* Persona: This is the PC's personality.  This often times can be tied to the characters backstory, but does not have to be.  Examples of persona may include the PC's temper, mannerisms, quirks, irritants, etc.
* Character Sheet: These are the abilities that the PC can perform within the rules of the Crestfallen LARP game.  Items found on the Character Sheet include lineage, Body Points, Essence Points, Stamina Points, Energy Points, Skill Categories, Skills, Bank Funds, and notes regarding the character.
* Costuming and Gear:  These are the physical representations that the player uses for the PC.  These may include Lineage prosthetics/paint, weapons, potions, wands, and tagged items.

As mentioned before, everyone will use this rulebook differently to make characters.  Here are a number of suggested ways to make a character.  All players should review the Code of Conduct and Philosophies section of the book first due to their importance mentioned in the disclaimer.

Also remember that you need to leave room for your character to grow. Do not purchase skills that you do not have (or plan to have in the near future) the physical representations or ability to use.

Finally it is important to remember that you are one character in a bigger community.  You cannot do everything and will often need the help of others to accomplish goals.  It is not suggested to build an anti-social character or a character that is does not have a core category that helps express the characters identity.



## How to make a character when focusing on story/lineage

A player who wants to focus on story should first look at all of the In Game information about the game world and lineages.  These sections include Lineages, Mixed Lineages, Lineage Skill Categories, and the Persona Guide.  This reading will give players basic information on Katalossa (the Crestfallen game world), the lineages of the Inspired, and the skills that are special to each lineage.  After this reading, the player can determine which lineage they would like to play and different Persona and Backstory elements.  Once the Backstory and Persona is established, the player may already have an idea of what style of character they want to build on their Character Sheet.  The player should review the different Points Systems to understand the different types and how they work.  Following this they should focus on the Combat, Magic, and Skills system to determine their categories and skills.  The player will end with creating the costuming and gear based on what they require from the previous steps.



## How to make a character when focusing on skills and categories

A player who wants to focus on their skills and categories will first look at the Skills list to determine what skills they wish to take.  This may include reviewing the Combat, Magic, or Crafting sections to understand how these work.  Once a player determines what skills they would like to have, they will usually then look that the lineage choices to find out which lineage has the most discounts or best skills to complement their skill choices.  After this the player will create a Persona and Backstory based on the skills and lineage they have ultimately chosen.  The player will end with creating the costuming and gear based on what they require from the previous steps.



## How to make a character when focusing on physical ability

A player needs to take into account their own physical abilities.  If a player is limited in what activities they wish to take part in or medically are limited on activities, the player should first review the skills list to determine their limitations.  This may determine what kinds of skills the player may take, what lineage abilities or physreps they may use, and what counted actions they may need to be aware of.  Once skills and lineage are determined, the player will create a Persona and Backstory based on the previous choices and limitations.  The player will end with creating the costuming and gear based on what they require from the previous steps.



## How to make a character when focusing on costuming and gear

A player will focus on costuming and gear that they already own if there are major budget issues.  The player should focus on skills, categories, and lineage based on the gear they already posses or that do not require gear.  After this the player will create a Persona and Backstory based on the skills and lineage they have ultimately chosen.  The player will end with creating the costuming and gear based on what they require from the previous steps.
