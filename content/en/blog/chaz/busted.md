Crestfallen Larp Busted Builds #1: The rage caster (or the Tasmanian Dirt Devil)

At an entry cost of just 20cp this build is interesting, fun, and customizable.

For our purposes you will need to be a Kinfolk (hence the Tasmanian devil part) and primarily be focused on Magical Combat.

We first choose Specialization for our chosen flavor of elemental damage. (I choose stone for this build).

We then pick up Berserk Augmentation from our lineage, which states thst when we are affected by berserk we can spend 1 stamina yo gain +2 to our physical attacks and +5 to our spell damage.

So at this point when we are berserked we can throw an infinite number of "6 <element> damage" for 10 minutes. (Albeit at the nearest targets, not discerning friend from foe).

By taking 1 level of Energy we can enhance the build by learning berserk/remove berserk allowing us to enter/remove this state at will.

With the right skills this could be a devastating hybrid build using claws and unarmed fighting as well becoming a horrifying force on the battlefield.

Give into the rage and melt everything you see. If your friends come too close use remove berserk to keep them safe. 

More busted builds to come! Hope you all enjoyed this one.

I am back with another Busted Build (#2) this time showing some love for the non-combat crowd.
We know that traditionally Orcs are terrifying fighters with massively strong arms- but didja know that they are JUST AS GOOD strongarming people as MERCHANTS?!
I give you my take on a pure merchant character, "Gimme Gimme":
This build is slightly bigger than a starting character to build but if you just want to show up to game, hang with your friends, and make TONS of leaves this is the start to a very shrewd businessman.
As an Orc you take 3 levels in Stamina for 6cp and Demand for 5cp. The stamina is necessary for our build and Demand states "This skill allows a character to pay half price or be paid double price for one object at a guild." and costs 2 stamina.
We then spend 5cp to unlock the Merchant Category where we get our real meat and potatoes. The crux of our build is 15cp for Requisition which allows a character to gain 1 item from a guilds item list for free. (for 4 Stamina) We also pick up Equal Trade for 10cp (1 stamina) allowing us to sell an item to the guild for it's going rate, and Haggle 10cp (1 stamina) to increase or decrease the cost/value of an item sold/bought by 1.
They don't want us to do this though, so we also have to be a Merchant Guild Member too (10cp).
So, we begin game at 61cp and 8 stamina. We spend 4 stamina (4 left) to requisition the guild for a free item. We then use Demand (2 stamina) Equal Trade (1 stamina) and Haggle (1 stamina) to turn around and sell the guild it's own item back for double it's value plus 1.
This uses all our stamina- because business is HARD- so we go and take it easy with our friends, throw back a few drinks and rest up for 4 hours. At which point we have regained our stamina and can repeat the process until we are too tired.
When we get into higher levels this build can get RIDICULOUSLY INSANE by adding Holdings to start the game with more leaves, or branching into the thievery category to steal more wares and open up access to the Thieves Guild Stockpile.
In the immortal words of the savior of humanity, John Connor:
"Easy Money"

Hey everyone! It’s time for another BUSTED BUILD! (#3 for those keeping track). We have another thematic build that comes online with only an initial investment of 20 build with the appropriate category unlocked but going with the theme we will be building it out as a fully fleshed in starting character.
The concept we are following today is the tried-and-true pacifist monk- or if you prefer the flavor, an Oath of Redemption paladin with a few tweaks. The concept revisits the non-proficient weapon fighting concept this time as flavor, painting our character as someone who wishes to not harm other creatures despite having to defend themselves.
In combat they will rely not on their damage, but on incapacitating enemies quickly and efficiently.
We begin with our chosen lineage; any will work fine but the build benefits most from picking a lineage that grants a bonus to stamina as our build relies heavily on it’s use.
So, I will be going Human and picking up Adaptable for +2 stamina.
We then unlock the group combat category and purchase Stagger (10cp, 2 Stam cost) and Waylay (10cp, 2 Stam cost). Both skills allow us for the cost of 2 stamina to inflict either Daze or Sleep, which are powerful conditions that can take a foe out of combat in a single blow.
Daze states that an afflicted target stares off into space, not noticing or remembering anything happening for 5 minutes or until cured or attacked. If left on a target for the full 5 minutes the target “believes that nothing is wrong and tries to go back to what they were doing, assuming that they were sleepy or zoned out for a moment.” If this is the case, there is no way for them to regain these memories.
Sleep states that an afflicted target falls asleep and retains no sensory knowledge of anything until removed. There is no duration.
These skills allow us for 2 stamina to make up to 3 attacks with these conditions until we either hit or the effect is resisted.
So at this point we can make an unarmed attack (not proficient, so we will be swinging our “fist” (or a sword if you’re going for the paladin flavor) for 1 damage) and with 2 stamina we can either debilitate a target with daze (forcing them to either forget about us or distracting them for long enough to deal with other threats) or put them to sleep and possibly take them out of the encounter permanently.
At this point we have spent 25cp and have 5 Hp and 7 Stamina, which isn’t the best for a “fighter” so in my building I’d take 5 levels of Stamina (15cp) rounding us up to 12 stamina, and 4 levels of Body bringing us up to 9 Hp.
This amount of stamina (assuming we can hit with one of 3 swings and not be resisted) will allow us to incapacitate 6 enemies if we are fully rested once every 6 hours. While not the best this can aid in certain quests.
If you have a module you signed up for to retrieve stolen goods run in with reckless abandon and daze your way through the enemies and grab the item, leaving them wondering where it went and why their heads hurt.
If you need to bring back specimens for someone’s surgery experiments, go out and waylay a few down and drag them back to town.
The options are endless.

Daily didja know? #1
Didja know according to the rules you DO NOT have to be proficient with a melee weapon or shield to use it?
Per the often-overlooked weapon combat rules any character may wield a melee weapon or shield despite not being proficient. 
For melee weapons this reduces the damage call for the weapon to "1 damage" regardless of base damage dealt with those weapons.
Shields are a bit trickier however as rules state that any shield (or armor) wielded while not proficient acts as though it were broken. Referencing the broken condition, we learn this means any blow taken to a broken shield deals 1 point of damage to the wielder.
So, in instances where monsters are swinging for high damage pulling out that shield and reducing their blows to 1 damage might be worth it!
So, if monsters start throwing shatters make sure to get your resident unskilled shield wall out there to soak those 1s for the people who ACTUALLY know how to use their shields!

Daily Didja Know #2
Didja know that just because the game is just starting, and you aren't a Mr. Fancypants who has secret holdings or a family stockpile it doesn't mean you have to be poor?
The merchant's guild runs the game world bank (The Bank) and per the rules in the book:
"... the Bank offers loans to characters. The 
bank will loan leaves in increments of 10 at the rate of 1 leaf interest per event. (Example: Your character borrows 30 leaves from the bank. If you pay this loan back during the same event, you must repay 33 leaves. If you repay the following event, you must repay 36 leaves....39...42...45, 
etc.) "
Now you DO have to be wary however as there are stipulations:
"If a character ever reaches an amount owed of two times what was borrowed, the character may be put up for bounty to the Thieves Guild. These amounts may change but will be detailed in the Merchants Guild folder."
That's not so bad though eh?
So, what are ya waiting for? Take out a loan today! Katalossa is a dangerous place and Oz can't give you the knowledge or enchantments you need to survive if he doesn't get paid first!

Daily didja know #3
For those who are interested in building up a craftsman (and more specifically those who intend on getting to the point of technology crafting which blends two or more other crafts) you may have been overwhelmed at the sheer cost of increasing your talents, but I am here to help!
While each craft (Forging, Alchemy, and Enchanting) requires you to have an augmentation skill and mastery skill for the highest-grade items, (and if you intend on solo crafting technology later you'll need more than one) there is only one augmentation skill (crafting augmentation) and one mastery skill (crafting mastery).
This means that if you start as a master alchemist (alchemy, crating augmentation, crafting mastery) and decide to pick up forging later your purchase of crafting augmentation and crafting mastery apply to forging as well!
This means that while many thought these skills were per craft, requiring a MASSIVE amount of cp to master all crafts (140 for just all 3 crafts mastered or 170 for technology crafting) the actual cost is far cheaper at only 70 cp to master all 3 crafts or 100 to master them and open technology crafting.
This means that any of the folks who showed up to the previous playtests and play this event could be sporting a master craftsman of all 3 crafts as early as the first event next year!

Daily Didja Know #4 - The shameless plug.
Did you know that the lands of Katalossa have their very own fortuneteller?
A roaming wanderer, a man by the name of Oz doles out fortunes, predictions, and blessings for a price.
It is rumored he will be giving a free divination to the gathered adventurers at the upcoming event, however he will also be offering personal readings and his specific talents of divination to those who wish it. Blessings, divinations, and personal information acquired is on a first come first paid basis so don't miss out!
Make sure that if you do not have any leaves that you contact The Bank and take out a small loan should you wish to buy in. As the merchant's guild will tell you: Money talks and BS walks.
