Did you know that the lands of Katalossa have their very own fortuneteller?

A roaming wanderer, a man by the name of Oz doles out fortunes, predictions, and blessings for a price.

It is rumored he will be giving a free divination to the gathered adventurers at the upcoming event, however he will also be offering personal readings and his specific talents of divination to those who wish it. Blessings, divinations, and personal information acquired is on a first come first paid basis so don't miss out!

Make sure that if you do not have any leaves that you contact The Bank and take out a small loan should you wish to buy in. As the merchant's guild will tell you: Money talks and BS walks.
