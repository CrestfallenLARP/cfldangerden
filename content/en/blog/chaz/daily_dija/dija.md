Didja know according to the rules you DO NOT have to be [proficient](/rules/conditions/#proficiency) with a melee weapon or shield to use it?

Per the often-overlooked weapon combat rules any character may wield a melee weapon or shield despite not being [proficient](/rules/conditions/#proficiency). 

For melee weapons this reduces the damage call for the weapon to "1 [damage](/rules/conditions/#damage)" regardless of base damage dealt with those weapons.

Shields are a bit trickier however as rules state that any shield (or armor) wielded while not [proficient](/rules/conditions/#proficiency) acts as though it were [broken](/rules/conditions/#broken-break). Referencing the [broken](/rules/conditions/#broken-break) condition, we learn this means any blow taken to a [broken](/rules/conditions/#broken-break) shield deals 1 point of [damage](/rules/conditions/#damage) to the wielder.

So, in instances where monsters are swinging for high damage pulling out that shield and reducing their blows to 1 damage might be worth it!

So, if monsters start throwing [shatters](/rules/#shatter) make sure to get your resident unskilled shield wall out there to soak those 1s for the people who ACTUALLY know how to use their shields!
