At an entry cost of just 20cp this build is interesting, fun, and customizable.

For our purposes you will need to be a Kinfolk (hence the Tasmanian devil part) and primarily be focused on Magical Combat.

We first choose Specialization for our chosen flavor of elemental damage. (I choose stone for this build).

We then pick up Berserk Augmentation from our lineage, which states that when we are affected by berserk we can spend 1 stamina yo gain +2 to our physical attacks and +5 to our spell damage.

So at this point when we are berserked we can throw an infinite number of "6 <element> damage" for 10 minutes. (Albeit at the nearest targets, not discerning friend from foe).

By taking 1 level of Energy we can enhance the build by learning berserk/remove berserk allowing us to enter/remove this state at will.

With the right skills this could be a devastating hybrid build using claws and unarmed fighting as well becoming a horrifying force on the battlefield.

Give into the rage and melt everything you see. If your friends come too close use remove berserk to keep them safe. 

More busted builds to come! Hope you all enjoyed this one.
