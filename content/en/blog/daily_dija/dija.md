Didja know according to the rules you DO NOT have to be proficient with a melee weapon or shield to use it?

Per the often-overlooked weapon combat rules any character may wield a melee weapon or shield despite not being proficient. 

For melee weapons this reduces the damage call for the weapon to "1 damage" regardless of base damage dealt with those weapons.

Shields are a bit trickier however as rules state that any shield (or armor) wielded while not proficient acts as though it were broken. Referencing the broken condition, we learn this means any blow taken to a broken shield deals 1 point of damage to the wielder.

So, in instances where monsters are swinging for high damage pulling out that shield and reducing their blows to 1 damage might be worth it!

So, if monsters start throwing shatters make sure to get your resident unskilled shield wall out there to soak those 1s for the people who ACTUALLY know how to use their shields!
