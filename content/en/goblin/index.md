## Opening (3) Introduction of Zelvin, Goblin Attack, Planning Ahead  

### Introduction of Zelvin

Zelvin will enter the tavern wearing a cloak and hood with a lit cigar, (the prop is a fake light up one). He will look for Oz first since he was the one to charm Ziggy which made him an ally to him. If Oz is preoccupied, he will try to find Mattias.  He will tell one (or both given the situation) that he is thankful for their help and that he wanted to meet them face to face since Ziggy talked about them nonstop. He will take the time to answer any questions if they have any.   

Roles: Zelvin  

## Goblin Attack

Goblins come into the tavern looking for Zelvin but they will kindly leave if they are handed enough leaves to satisfy them (25 leaves). If they are not paid they will attack. They will give 3 leaves on their first reset, 2 on their second, and 1 on the last reset. They can be harvested for 2 basic resources. One of the goblins will have a note.  

Roles: Zelvin, Goblin Warrior x4 (3 Resets). 

Prop: Note   



## Planning Ahead

The note states that there are 3 supply lines that are heading to a goblin encampment, the first one has a time in a bottle, 50 leaves, and a strange bottle that glows green. The second one has an assortment of wands and a weapon of harvesting. The final one has 3 healing potions, meals, spices, cots, and tanglefoot bags. The note mentions the time frames of the shipments making it difficult to stop all three. Only 2 can be stopped.
