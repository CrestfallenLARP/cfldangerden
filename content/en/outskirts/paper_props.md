**Author Info and thought process** - Alfonse is a human middle manager for a very evil and manipulative thieves guild known as the Shadow Brand. He is mainly a spellcaster and tactician.  Once a loyal family man, he has betrayed everything he has once loved in the name of the guild and rising to power.  These four notes are the final version of his plan to distract the players using the monster factions as bait.  The plan is well thought out, but having less intelligent people directing things may become messy.

**What are these.** These are the final drafts of his plan. These copies are his while a second set has been sent to the main Shadow Brand HQ. If all goes well this will allow Alfonse to rise in the ranks. Failure may cause disaster for his asperations.  These should all be standard paper size.

These are very calculated documents, so they are not rushed but also not very fancy.  They should be organized and clean (a departure from the rushed notes and accounts from others that clutter his desk).

He is proud of his work, but fearful it may be intercepted and his plan will be foiled. He intends to keep these as a trophy if things go well, but wants them to not be easily found.  He would have purposely folded these items as if to send by courier and to not draw attention.  I will make lots of other side notes and reports to go with these so they may be lost in the clutter.

## Note 1 

is about organizing a tunnel to be dug from the local farms to meet with a gnoll cave system.  The guild has hired outside expendable workers to dig the tunnel for very few leaves. The people are desperate and need the money.  The remaining wall will be triggered with and explosive to draw out the gnolls.  This letter should have very subtle writing that infers this is to be timed with the next 2 letters. It can include basic drawings of the tunnel/caves, explosive placement. Whatever additions feel comfortable.

## Note 2 

is intelligence on the local goblin warlord planning an attack on the merchant warehouse in Boulderton proper. The guild has created a mock caravan that includes a powerful bomb for the goblins to steal and use as their primary attack on the warehouse.  This is the event that the other two must be timed with. The goblins are much to chaotic to organize with. 

## Note 3 

is giving the Undead an Elven Mage that was captured in exchange for a non agression pact between the guild and undead. Alfonse is aware this pact will be short lived, but will plant information of the creation of another white bone undead among the adventurers hoping it will be appropriate bait.

## Note 4 

is the actual plan that the three other notes are a diversion for.  The note describes an essence guardian lizardfolk location. The guild will send assassins and dolls to claim one of the creatures and kill any others found.  The creature will be sent to the main headquarters for study, experimentation, and eventual compliance mutation.
