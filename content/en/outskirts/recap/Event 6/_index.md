recap: During the 6th week of the Scatter, a magical tavern known as The Bearded Banshee appeared in Boulderton. Local residents and adventurers gathered within the tavern as the news of the Empyrean Conjunction drew in patrons. Visitors were welcomed with food, drink, games, and a mysterious constellation board. During the festivities, patrons were able to partake in Displacer Draught, a glowing green concoction that allowed the granted extra information and abilities to those who drank it. Using the constellation board allowed Benzihk, Ieyasu, Ephram, Xurd, and Keuyar to be chosen as paragons for the upcoming season until the next conjunction is completed.
