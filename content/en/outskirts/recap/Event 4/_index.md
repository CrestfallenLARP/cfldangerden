title: 4th Week of the Scatter, 1488
layout: recap
date: 2023-10-09
recap: The red bone undead swarmed the outskirts once more, but were called out by Oz and the White Bone Undead showed up.  Lured in with more people tied to magic, the attack was less planned than usual.  With Ogrim using a slay and Oz using harm undead, the white bone undead had little chance and was destroyed.  Following this the new adventurers Ogrim and Jimbo spoke with a wolf kinfolk about Teduardo and also to a child with a firearm (which they shattered).  The child was upset and went to the outpost to fix his gun and complain.  Red Bone undead were assaulted, but a corpse was found crystalized in a cave.  Oz became a spirit and tried to converse with it.  While in spirit form, the other adventurers attempted to shatter the body, but it absorbed the magic, allowing the white bone to reform and steal energy from oz.  A storyteller came into town with tales and poems.  The body of the Eagle Kinfolk Research Guild member was found, poisoned by smelling salts and attempted to implicate Mattias but was setup by the Shadowbrand.  Fire elementals were talked to and were offered the next meteorite piece.  Lightning Elementals were talked with and demanded the part was destroyed in front of them. Jimbo destroyed the meteorite piece and the lightning was appeased.  The Fire will be angry soon.  Goblins were killed at an encampment, a dwarven hammer was found, and many leaves shared.  A mysterious helpful goblin secreted a letter to Mattias discussing a rift between the goblins and the possibility of working with a faction.
