overview: The adventurers battled a number of undead, including the white bone.  This combat was difficult and almost killed some of the town.  The adventurers feel the white bone is too powerful for them to deal with currently.  A number of random townsfolk traveled to the outskirts to see what was going on.  A traveling merchant, Van Mullins was found to be a merchant of "sniffle shits" a blatant rip off of smelling salts.  Van Mullins was then determined to be a member of the thieves guild that created the doll golems to attack kinfolk and was interrogated.  During the interrogation and spirit showed up behind him and murdered him through a tattoo on his back.  The adventurers were able to fix a problem with the fire elementals (capturing lightning in a bottle) and an economic crisis by returning resources from a goblin camp to the craft guild.
