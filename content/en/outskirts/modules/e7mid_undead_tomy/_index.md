title: Undead Tomy
layout: module
schedule: mid event
brief: This module will occur at 2 PM. LEX will send their automaton to the adventurers and ask them to go an speak with the person known as TOMY. LEX and TOMY have been speaking for the past few hours and they are becoming fast friends. LEX feels that they may trust TOMY but wishes for a second opinion. Multiple waves of undead are found on the way to where TOMY is located. When the adventurers get near TOMY's location, a voice radius repel undead effect will be called by the actor of TOMY. TOMY is a basic AI that is looking to help other robots and intelligences in need. TOMY can convert LEX into a different form in order to escape the building and join others like it. The players may question TOMY as they like as well as use other skills on or about it. When the repel effect wears off, the undead will swarm in against the adventurers again. Red bone undead will have 5 resets and 1 leaf per reset as treasure. They may be harvested for 1 basic resource. The goal of this module is to talk with TOMY, get a feel for the character, and if it can be trusted to be helpful or harmful. PROP TOMY Toy Computer
