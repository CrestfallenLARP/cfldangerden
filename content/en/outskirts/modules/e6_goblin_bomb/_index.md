title: Goblin Bomb
layout: module
schedule: ending
brief: This is one module of 4 possible ending modules to try to minimize damage to Boulderton proper.  The goblins have created a large bomb and have placed it outside the Boulderton merchants guild location and are trying to steal as many goods as possible. If the PCs show up, can stop the bomb, and kill half of the goblins, the others flee.  If the PCs don't show up or half are not killed and the PCs are stopped, the goblins get a number of resources and start on training their members for next event. Treasure is found on creatures only. This module will be set up with the bathrooms acting as the building.
