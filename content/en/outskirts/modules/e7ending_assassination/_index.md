brief: This module will occur at 7 PM at the Gathering Hall. TOMY has concerns regarding a few of the adventurers that they had met with. Worried that LEX will make a wrong decision, the AI plans an assassination attempt against them. If a white bone undead is available, it will use red bone undead to pull the majority of adventurers away and then magically teleport to where the targets are to attempt to kill them quickly. Red bone undead will have 3 resets with 1 leaf per reset. They may be harvested for 1 basic resource. The white bone undead will have 1 leaf, 2 basic resource cards and an item card.
