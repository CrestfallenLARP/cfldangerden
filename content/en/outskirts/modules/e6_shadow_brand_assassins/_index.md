title: Shadow Brand Assassins
layout: module
schedule: ending
brief: This is one module of 4 possible ending modules to try to minimize damage to Boulderton proper. After finding the notes in the Shadow Brand outpost and sniffing out the assassins location using deduction, analysis, search location, or scientific research, the PCs find that the main goal of the Shadow Brand is to capture and study one of the lizardfolk. There are assassins and ceramic dolls attempting to make this attack. The Shadow Brand members are well trained but very limited, hoping to have the element of surprise.  Each assassin has a tagged firearm, resources, and leaves. The dolls have leaves. This module will be set up across the covered bridge if possible. If not, this module will use the far field close to the road as its ambush point.
