title: Undead Gathering Hall Attack
layout: module
schedule: opening
brief: This module will occur at 8AM to open the combat portion of the event. The undead of Katalossa are barely holding on at this moment. There is one white bone undead, a mid tier general, and none of the more powerful forces are currently available. The red bone undead are attempting to steal the energy from the local townsfolk before it can be used. The goal of the red bone undead is to drop and steal the energy from anyone they see using magic, hoping to create additional white bone undead. The attack will have 4 to 6 waves of red bone undead, depending on the marshal call. Each Undead has 1 leaf as treasure per reset. They may be harvested for 1 basic resource.
