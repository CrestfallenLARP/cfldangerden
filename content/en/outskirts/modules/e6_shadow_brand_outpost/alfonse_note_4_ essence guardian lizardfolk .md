## Note 4 

is the actual plan that the three other notes are a diversion for.  The note describes an essence guardian lizardfolk location. The guild will send assassins and dolls to claim one of the creatures and kill any others found.  

The creature will be sent to the main headquarters for study, experimentation, and eventual compliance mutation.
