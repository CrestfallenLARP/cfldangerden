## Note 4 

is the actual plan that the three other notes are a diversion for. The note describes an essence guardian lizardfolk location. The guild will send assassins and dolls to claim one of the creatures and kill any others found. 

The creature will be sent to the main headquarters for study, experimentation, and eventual compliance mutation.

This is a hook for [Shadow Brand assassins](/outskirts/modules/e6_shadow_brand_assassins/)



> 4 Members and 6 dolls should be sufficient.

> A small cavern has been scouted past the lake. Targets are injured greatly by harming magic, but are immune to Ice and Lightning. A number of them have innate healing magics, so silence or sleep to neutralize their ability to stay in the fight is a must. One must be captured for study and experimentation. They will be sent off as soon as possible. This is to ensure a rescue mission will not be attempted. Mutation efforts should be swift, though we are unsure if they will take hold on this first subject. We are hopeful that tissue samples will be enough to test for later viability. Following the mission, we will retreat to Urnst until it is safe to return.
