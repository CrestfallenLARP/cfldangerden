## Note 2 

is intelligence on the local goblin warlord planning an attack on the merchant warehouse in Boulderton proper. The guild has created a mock caravan that includes a powerful bomb for the goblins to steal and use as their primary attack on the warehouse.  This is the event that the other two must be timed with. The goblins are much to chaotic to organize with.
