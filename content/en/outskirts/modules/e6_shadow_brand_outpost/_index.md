title: Shadow Brand Outpost
layout: module
schedule: mid event
brief: Oz set up a meeting with a member of the Sanguine Palm, the theives guild of the Inspired. The Sanguine Palm will use the new player member as the hook or an NPC member using the shadow brand rogue card if necessary (not an actual shadow brand member). They are not a fan of this organization moving in on their territory and have told Oz that they hail from Urnst, a large city along the mountain range. This city is 5 to 10 days travel away but is apparently spreading its influence once more. The palm will send a member to lead the adventurers on a raid on the outpost. There will be a number of guards and clay dolls with a small treasure box and leaves on each npc. Found within will be a number of documents outlining setting up the four ending modules. After finding the notes in the Shadow Brand outpost the players may sniff out the true goal of the Shadow Brand using deduction, analysis, search location, or scientific research. The PCs find that the main goal of the Shadow Brand is to capture and study one of the lizardfolk.
