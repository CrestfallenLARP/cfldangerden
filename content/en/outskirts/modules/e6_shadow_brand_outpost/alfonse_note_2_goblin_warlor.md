## Note 2 

is intelligence on the local goblin warlord planning an attack on the merchant warehouse in Boulderton proper. The guild has created a mock caravan that includes a powerful bomb for the goblins to steal and use as their primary attack on the warehouse.  This is the event that the other two must be timed with. The goblins are much to chaotic to organize with.

Clattig is the warlords name. We havent set everything up yet, but he has murdered some of Dade's mutiny leaders family/important people leading to the rift.

Clattig has been taking in all of the goblinoids that have shifted through portals and are using their info to help grow his warband. Its adding more new tech than he expected.

this is a hook for [Goblin Bomb](/outskirts/modules/e6_goblin_bomb/)

> We have received a good amount of intel regarding the goblins and their plans over the next few weeks. Shroud has found that during the 5th Week of the Scatter, the local warband is planning a large attack on the merchants guild in Boulderton proper. This attack is expected to gain resources and leaves from the merchants and craft guild during their mid month meeting at roughly 5 in the afternoon. Knave has found that a number of the goblins are searching for resources to make an explosive. We have scheduled a caravan for two days before the meeting to pass through goblin territory for them to "acquire" the parts that they need.  We will send Dick and Harry as the caravan drivers.  This will deal with two issues at once.  As for Tom, we will send him along to speak with the undead and the offering letter. Sentinel will finalize timing to match the goblin attack in case of changes.  He is prepared to be of sacrifice if needed.
