title: Apflonse Notes Overview
---

**Author Info and thought process** - Alfonse is a human middle manager for a very evil and manipulative thieves guild known as the Shadow Brand. He is mainly a spellcaster and tactician.  Once a loyal family man, he has betrayed everything he has once loved in the name of the guild and rising to power.  These four notes are the final version of his plan to distract the players using the monster factions as bait.  The plan is well thought out, but having less intelligent people directing things may become messy.

**What are these.** These are the final drafts of his plan. These copies are his while a second set has been sent to the main Shadow Brand HQ. If all goes well this will allow Alfonse to rise in the ranks. Failure may cause disaster for his asperations.  These should all be standard paper size.

These are very calculated documents, so they are not rushed but also not very fancy.  They should be organized and clean (a departure from the rushed notes and accounts from others that clutter his desk).

He is proud of his work, but fearful it may be intercepted and his plan will be foiled. He intends to keep these as a trophy if things go well, but wants them to not be easily found.  He would have purposely folded these items as if to send by courier and to not draw attention.  I will make lots of other side notes and reports to go with these so they may be lost in the clutter.
