## Note 1 

is about organizing a tunnel to be dug from the local farms to meet with a gnoll cave system.  The guild has hired outside expendable workers to dig the tunnel for very few leaves. The people are desperate and need the money.  The remaining wall will be triggered with and explosive to draw out the gnolls.  This letter should have very subtle writing that infers this is to be timed with the next 2 letters. It can include basic drawings of the tunnel/caves, explosive placement. Whatever additions feel comfortable.
