Pioneer Card, number, and Name

Roles:

The first three fields are on the posters, the next 4 fields are in the writeups page, the roles will be added from the factions or characters page.

Eventually if I could just add the top three fields and then it auto generates the card to be posted, that would be great, but not at all realistic for this event.
