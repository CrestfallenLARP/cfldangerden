title: Assault and Battery
layout: pioneer_card
non_combat:
  post: The hauflin is making batteries and needs assistance. This takes 10 minutes of RP from someone with tech crafting.  If players help, they will get a card for a battery or learn how to craft their own.
  reward: Battery or Battery Design
combat:
  post: The hauflin should have hired some guards.  Their works are destroyed though a scientist could figure out what they were doing if they have enough time and questions.  Sadly the Goblins have run off with most of the supplies needed to create anything.
  reward: Goblins have 1 leaf per reset, 1 basic resource if harvested from and 10 basic resources stolen from the hauflin should be on a lead goblin and found on regular search.
