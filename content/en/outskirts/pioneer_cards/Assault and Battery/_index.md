## Assault and Battery 3

Non-Combat - The hauflin is making batteries and needs assistance.  If players help, they will get a card for a battery or learn how to craft their own.

Combat - The hauflin should have hired some guards.  Their works are destroyed though a scientist could figure out what they were doing if they have enough time and questions.  Sadly the monsters have run off with most of the supplies needed to create anything.

Non-Combat Reward - Battery or Battery Design

Combat Reward - Resources and leaves from monsters
