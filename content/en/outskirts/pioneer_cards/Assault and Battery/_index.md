non_combat:
  post: The hauflin is making batteries and needs assistance.  If players help, they will get a card for a battery or learn how to craft their own.
  reward: Battery or Battery Design
combat:
  post: The hauflin should have hired some guards.  Their works are destroyed though a scientist could figure out what they were doing if they have enough time and questions.  Sadly the monsters have run off with most of the supplies needed to create anything.
  reward:  Resources and leaves from monsters
