title: Recover the tools of the Forge
type: "docs"
post: The Crafting Guild has reported a lost forge in the area. Many suspect that goblins near the mountains have taken it. Scout the local caves and return the tools if possible. This should include a crate, saw, and two pick axes.
reward: 20 leaves or Forge Recipe to those who return the items.
