title: Reclaim stolen resources


post: A chest of stolen resources must be brought back, or no new items will be able to be created for next adventure day. 
reward: 20 leaves if all resources are returned. 10 if any resources are missing.
props: Chest with treasure and resource cards
summary: This job is a search and rescue style mission.  A number of undead have stolen a large stockpile of resources from a caravan.  The players must destroy the undead and safely return with the resources.  This will allow all lineages/guilds to make new items for next event.  If this is not completed, the lineages/guilds don't have the resources to build anything.
