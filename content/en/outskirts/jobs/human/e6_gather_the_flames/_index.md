title: Gather the Flames
props: none
reward: 20 leaves
post: The fire elemental creatures have become enraged and left the area. They have been attacking farms around the outskirts of Port Jebbeddo and Boulderton.  A mass of them have formed in the wilds and the local area has gotten extremely cold. Go and destroy these sentient energies and let them disperse to allow the balance to reform. Grab some of their essence to bring back for crafting!
summary: Job will be set up near the solo tree near the lake but with constant forming fire elementals.
