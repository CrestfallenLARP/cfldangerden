title: Clockwork Challenge
props: none
reward: 15 leaves
post: There are constructs made of clockwork that have been sighted near Boulderton. We want to know if they are are challenge and would like to learn more about them. 
summary: Lex's constructs meet these descriptions.  The orcs can battle them or try to talk their way through things.  Golems may so "you know lex?" but otherwise cannot converse.  If PCs say "friend" after questioning about lex, the creatures will stand down and lex will talk through them.
