title: Honor and Valor
type: "docs"
post: The Goblins in the local area have been weakened by a group of armored constructs. This bodes well for the local people. We want to see the Goblins driven from the local area for a while. Due to some scouting, we believe we know where their main encampment is. Scare them off to reduce their prominence in the area. 
reward: 20 leaves or 10 basic resources or 3 common resources.
