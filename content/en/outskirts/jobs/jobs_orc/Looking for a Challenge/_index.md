title: Looking for a Challenge
type: "docs"
post: There are few challenging creatures to battle in Imshcran. We hear tale of a dangerous monster known as a troll. Please battle, subdue, and return the creature to us. We wish to judge its prowess ourselves. 
reward: 40 leaves to the group that captures and returns with the creature.
