Hi everyone and hope that we are all looking forward to a better 2023!

Tuesday (1/3) will be our next Discord Hangout from 430 to 630! During this hangout we will discuss character backgrounds, skills to base backgrounds on, and projects for creative folks to feel close to the world. 

Additionally we will be discussing some of the moves we have been making such as costuming, websites, and everything in between. If anyone has specific questions regarding these points, feel free to ask. Ideally we hope to do more on discord and our own website than what we currently do here, but it is a work in progress. 

See you on Tuesday!Bear
