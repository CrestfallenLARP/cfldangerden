Here is a basic review of the Discord Hangout from May 5th, 2023

4:30:    Open discussion regarding player interests
4:50:    Project Design Guide questions
5:05:    Port Jebeddo Article questions
5:20:    Rough Business costs breakdown
5:30:    Upcoming event info (prereg, costs, etc)
5:50:    Folder Access
6:00:    Craft Day discussion
6:15:    Swap Meet discussion

Reactions to the Project Design Guide and Port Jebeddo articles were positive overall.  The next articles planned by Bear are a guide to spell creation and an in game article about Zarn the Dwarven Citadel.

Business current costs were shared with all in attendance.  These are costs that occured prior to forming BearNPC LLC.  As previously discussed, there are no employees for BearNPC Productions, including the owner.  No one, including the owner, will be paid until the game can sustain itself on its own.  I (Bear) stated that I am not expecting to regain any of the funds from these purchases, but it was said by multiple sources that I should be paid back these fund.  This will be a topic for later discussion and publicly released before any repayment may occur.

Event info is coming out in steady patches.  Prereg, registration, payment, folder access and additional info will be available via schedule page on 5/5/2023.

Craft Day and Swap Meet are in preliminary stages.  Offers by Scott to assist in weapon production and staff to help with other crafting prior to the event.

In order for the game and players to have an economy to start building items and equipment, we will be giving everyone that shows up to the hangout 5 leaves (In Game Money) and 1 Basic Resource.  Additionally for every 10 people that show up at the hangout, we will hold a raffle or vote for 5 additional Basic Resources.  These items dont have any real world value but are used in the game.

To receive these items a player must have their name and email on record and preferably sign up for a character number and sheet (last two not required but helps us track).
