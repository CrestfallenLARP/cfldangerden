Our next hangout on Discord is next Tuesday if everything goes according to plan and we are wondering what people will be interested in discussing!  I would love a more structured plan moving forward.

Please put your topics here or email us at [CrestfallenLARP@gmail.com](mailto:CrestfallenLARP@gmail.com)

I plan on having the crafting recipe rubric available, cleaned up and condensed info for the weapon construction section, and guidelines for the blaster/firearms section.

We really want to know what people are interested in and how to communicate multiple playstyles available.
