Hi all! We had a small but very effective meeting today.

We talked about ways to make the time sink skills more interesting, some items we should better clarify, and the importance of making NPCing enjoyable and worthwhile.

Additionally we will have more ways for players to gather resources with the gathering/harvesting skills.

Thanks to those that showed up and we look forward to the next hangout (hopefully in two weeks).

Beren
