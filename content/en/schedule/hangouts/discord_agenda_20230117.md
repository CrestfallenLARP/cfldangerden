Hangout 01/17 Agenda

4:30pm:    Player Q&A with staff / Addressing previously raised unanswered questions.
5:00pm:    Background building discussion with staff feedback
5:30pm:    Discussion about income assistance program and other cost of entry reduction ideas
5:50pm:    Discussion of Plot activities and planning
6:05pm:    Character builder sandbox reveal
6:20pm:    Closing thoughts and wrap up.

In order for the game and players to have an economy to start building items and equipment, we will be giving everyone that shows up to the hangout 5 leaves (In Game Money) and 1 Basic Resource.  Additionally for every 10 people that show up at the hangout, we will hold a raffle or vote for 5 additional Basic Resources.  These items dont have any real world value but are used in the game.

To receive these items a player must have their name and email on record and preferably sign up for a character number and sheet (last two not required but helps us track).

So, want to learn more but havent made it to a playtest? Come hang out with us. Note: you must have a discord account 24 hours prior to the event to sign in (blame the bots).
