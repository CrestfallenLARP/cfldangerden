  Hangout Recap

  The Crestfallen Staff has been overwhelmed over the past few months and have not kept a full agenda or record of the hangouts on discord.  We have discovered that the majority of the staff group are busy during the first few months of the year due to our primary jobs.  Due to this, we are changing our Discord Hangouts to once per month on the first Tuesday of the month from 430 to 630 PM.

  With our busy time behind us, here is a general overview of the previous meetings.  Moving forward we plan to have at least 2 articles prepared before each hangout including a planned agenda found here and minutes for the meetings that will be found here as well.

  Over the past few months we have really focused on being accessible to interested people and new players.  The following items were discussed.

  1. Blasters, weapons, shields, and costuming available to be borrowed.
  2. A possible discount/free event structure for those in financial distress.
  3. Granting interested/new players free time during one days to come and ask questions in person to dispel concerns.
  4. Granting interested/new players time during the beginning of every hangout to ask questions to help dispel concerns.
  5. Producing videos to help break the rules into easy to process segments.  Everyone learns differently.
  6. Clarify that staff are available to answer questions when needed.
  7. Offer a new player bootcamp for free at certain points during the year to help ease new player transition into the game.

  We also focused on the creation of the business behind the game and how we are structuring everything.  Crestfallen LARP is being produced by BearNPC Productions LLC which is currently being formed with the state of Pennsylvania.  We are trying to vary the styles of games that we will be producing.  During 2023 we will produce one day adventure and tavern events.  These are all documented on the Event Types section of the Schedule page.  BearNPC Productions will also be producing video content aiming to assist new LARPers to being prepared for attending LARPs, discuss topics for veteran LARPers that may be helpful, as well as information about Crestfallen LARP itself. Finally, we will be producing articles for the website based around Crestfallen LARP rules, character builds, roleplaying tips, and lore.

  Other topics that were discussed included cost transparency, ways to build content, ways to advertise for new players, prop creation and maintenance, website layout, and safety rules.

  When BearNPC Productions is finalized with the state, it is my intention to disclose all of the funds that I have been putting into the creation of Crestfallen LARP.  I want to the players to feel confident knowing that I am not making any money off of the game currently, but additionally, that I will only be paid when other supporting members are also paid.

  Finally, in order for the game and players to have an economy to start building items and equipment, we will be giving everyone that shows up to the hangout 5 leaves (In Game Money) and 1 Basic Resource.  Additionally for every 10 people that show up at the hangout, we will hold a raffle or vote for 5 additional Basic Resources.  These items dont have any real world value but are used in the game.

  To receive these items a player must have their name and email on record and preferably sign up for a character number and sheet (last two not required but helps us track).

  So, want to learn more but haven't made it to a playtest? Come hang out with us. Note: you must have a discord account 24 hours prior to the event to sign in (blame the bots).

  Due to our hangout minutes not being recorded as well as we had hoped, any player that attended at least one hangout from the beginning until now will receive 50 leaves and 10 basic resources on their sheet.  All discord hangouts will be tracked more efficiently and have the benefits as previously listed above.

  Next meeting is May 2nd from 4:30 to 6:30PM

  Until next time!
