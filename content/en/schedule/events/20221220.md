  Our next hangout on Discord is next Tuesday if everything goes according to plan and we are wondering what people will be interested in discussing!  I would love a more structured plan moving forward.

  Please put your topics here or email us at [CrestfallenLARP@gmail.com](mailto:CrestfallenLARP@gmail.com)

  I plan on having the crafting recipe rubric available, cleaned up and condensed info for the weapon construction section, and guidelines for the blaster/firearms section.

  We really want to know what people are interested in and how to communicate multiple playstyles available.

  Hi all! We had a small but very effective meeting today.

  We talked about ways to make the time sink skills more interesting, some items we should better clarify, and the importance of making NPCing enjoyable and worthwhile.

  Additionally we will have more ways for players to gather resources with the gathering/harvesting skills.

  Thanks to those that showed up and we look forward to the next hangout (hopefully in two weeks).

  Beren
