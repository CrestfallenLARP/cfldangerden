  In order for the game and players to have an economy to start building items and equipment, we will be giving everyone that shows up to the hangout 5 leaves (In Game Money) and 1 Basic Resource.  Additionally for every 10 people that show up at the hangout, we will hold a raffle or vote for 5 additional Basic Resources.  These items dont have any real world value but are used in the game.

  To receive these items a player must have their name and email on record and preferably sign up for a character number and sheet (last two not required but helps us track).

  So, want to learn more but havent made it to a playtest? Come hang out with us tomorrow. Note: you must have a discord account 24 hours prior to the event to sign in (blame the bots).

  Anything I missed? Chaz and Sheri feel free to post here.

  See you tomorrow!
