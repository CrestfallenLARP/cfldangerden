Crestfallen holds a number of different get togethers and events, each with their own benefits and possible costs.  We want to make sure that these event types are clear to attendees who are new to Crestfallen or LARP in general.  If there is any confusion, feel free to reach out to us via social media, email, or on our discord.  Links are available down below.

Our goal is to provide the best LARPing experience possible, **as often as possible.**

### **Discord Hangout** 

Crestfallen holds Discord Hangouts on a regular basis.  The main purpose for these are to create a place where new or interested people can ask questions from players and staff outside full events.  While we have a rough agenda planned out, these get togethers are a great way to clear up confusion, help plan a character, and get to know the community before even showing up to an event.  Our goal is to make people comfortable with the people and concepts of the game before committing to the travel and costuming of One and Two Day in person events.

These hangouts are out of game discussions only, though we may practice particular roleplaying elements at the request of players taking part.

**Cost**: None 

**Preregistration Deadline**: None - However if players wish to gain benefits, the players real name and email will be required. 

**Tentative Schedule**: First Tuesday of each month (See Schedule Page for details)
