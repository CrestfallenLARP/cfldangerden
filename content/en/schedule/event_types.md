Crestfallen holds a number of different get togethers and events, each with their own benefits and possible costs.  We want to make sure that these event types are clear to attendees who are new to Crestfallen or LARP in general.  If there is any confusion, feel free to reach out to us via social media, email, or on our discord.  Links are available down below.

Our goal is to provide the best LARPing experience possible, **as often as possible.** 

------

### **Discord Hangout** 

Crestfallen holds Discord Hangouts on a regular basis.  The main purpose for these are to create a place where new or interested people can ask questions from players and staff outside full events.  While we have a rough agenda planned out, these get togethers are a great way to clear up confusion, help plan a character, and get to know the community before even showing up to an event.  Our goal is to make people comfortable with the people and concepts of the game before committing to the travel and costuming of One and Two Day in person events.

These hangouts are out of game discussions only, though we may practice particular roleplaying elements at the request of players taking part.

**Cost**: None 

**Preregistration Deadline**: None - However if players wish to gain benefits, the players real name and email will be required. 

**Tentative Schedule**: First Tuesday of each month (See Schedule Page for details)

**Start Time**: 4:30 PM EST

**End Time**: 6:30 PM EST

**Character Benefits**:  5 Leaves (In Game Money) and 1 Basic Resource per person.  Additionally a raffle will be held for every 10 people that attend for 5 Basic Resources.  These are In Game items only and hold no real world value.

Friday night is typically focused around getting into character and planning Saturdays work (signing up for jobs in folders, discussing recent goings on, reading the All-of Branch paper, scouting the site, crafting, gathering, etc.).  Some small planned adventures may occur on Friday, but this is rare.  Saturday will focus on adventures, random encounters, and storyline.  Plot will shut down between 11PM and 1AM depending on site and plot requirements.  Sunday will focus on cleaning up loose ends such as adventures that needed to be rescheduled, as well as crafting, gathering, and acting among players.

**Gathering Hall**: The gathering hall is where players may access lineage and guild folders, roll for their gathering skill checks, and finalize their crafted items.  The gathering hall will be open for operation from game start until 1AM on Friday into Saturday, 8 AM until 1AM Saturday into Sunday, and 8AM until game end on Sunday.  These times are subject to change, but will be clearly listed at the gathering hall.  Players may use the crafting or gathering skills no more than 2 times while the gathering hall is closed and must complete their dice rolls before crafting or gathering again.

**New/Interested?**:  People who are interested in learning more about LARPing, new players, and new attendees to Crestfallen LARP are welcome to come and ask questions Friday evening from game start until 11 PM.
