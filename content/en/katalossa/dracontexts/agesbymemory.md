## The Flow of Time

Many new arrivals have asked to a timeline of Katalossan history.  This makes sense as history tends to occur in cycles, with follies often repeated if not learned from.  The best way to explain our time is to describe how it has been previously recorded.

### Ages

Ages are the most generic recordings of time on Katalossa.  Each Age is defined by a basic characteristic that defines it.  While there is no set amount of time per Age, each one has traditionally lasted roughly 1000 to 1500 years.  Often times people are not aware of what age they are in while it is occurring.  The Ages that have been previously recorded are in the following order.

- Creation - During this time the Draconic Essence formed Katalossa and their people.  Each lineage may have their own story of this time.  This was the least factually documented Age, but includes many stories of creation, elemental energy, factions, monsters, and randomness.  This Age ended with the creation of lineage home territories and trading.
- Man - This time period is defined by the technological development and wonder of the Human lineage.  It is stated that lineages such as the Elves and Dwarves did not view Humanity as an equal lineage.  In search of acceptance, a group of Humans bound themselves to creatures of another plane for power and knowledge.  This caused a dramatic increase in technological advancements for the Human lineage leading to the production of firearms, flying ships, and many other technological wonders.  Sadly this also caused great distrust among the other lineages, causing many battles.  War between the Human Lineage and a number of other Lineages and extraplanar creatures caused the transition to the following Age.
- Upheaval - Extraplanar creatures flooded the lands of Katalossa.  Different lineage groups learned quite a lot from these creatures and eventually formed the Paragons.  War raged on throughout this time.  This age ended with the Humans losing dominion of their cities and falling to the other lineage groups.  The forces that had tied themselves to the Humans were banished from Katalossa, along with a number of other extraplanar creatures.  The lineages with their Paragons found faith in themselves without outside powers, leading to the next Age.
- Faith - This time period found the Lineages starting to work together more and more.  The Paragons held dominion over Katalossa and guided their people.  This is when the forces of Unceasing reared their ugly head and attacked the plane in earnest.  A large undead dragon was tried to eliminate all life on Katalossa.  This Age ended with the destruction of the undead dragon.  By this time, many of the follies of the Humans were put to the side, as they had aided the other lineages in their battles against the Unceasing.
- Cycles - This Age is the most odd as it is the shortest, lasting only about 50 years.  During this time, the Inspired grew to prominence.  The lineages joined together to combat a number of outside foes that attempted to thwart them.  
- Departure - This Age began with the murder of the Elven Paragon.  From there all of the Paragons were either killed or ran and are in hiding.  The Unceasing swarmed Katalossa and  through the actions of the Great Dragons, were banished from it.  Time has wandered along and no new Ages have been named, thus we are continuing along within this Age.

## Katalossa's Calendar

Karalossa has started its latest Calendar based upon the death of the Elven Paragon in the year 1029 since the foundation of Caernarthan, the Elven capital during the Age of Faith.  The current Calendar is known as the Calendar of Arianwen and is in its 1488th cycle.  The calendar itself is broken into 5 months, each with 64 days.  Each month is tied to a planting season and are ordered as follows.  

- The Scatter - Known for the spreading of seeds.
- The Flourish - The time for nurturing growth and replenishment.
- The Yielding - The time for gathering, storing, and crafting.
- The Decay - The time where growth withers and dies in preparation of going dormant.
- The Rime - The time of ice and snow when the growth remains dormant until it is safe to sprout.

No copies of the Caernarthan Calendar or Calendar of Arianwen are known to survive the loss of the great tomes.  I am sure we will be able to rebuild from this basis as is necessary.
