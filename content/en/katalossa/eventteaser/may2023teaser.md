## First Week of the Scatter

It is the first week of the 1488th Cycle since the death of Arianwen, Paragon of the Elves.  Katalossa, home to the goodly races of the Inspired has seen peace for far too long.  The Unceasing, have been driven from the plane for over a thousand years and the goblins and gnolls have only been a minor inconvenience.

Recently, portals have opened up along Katalossa, depositing adventurers and enemies from different planes of existence.  No one knows why these portals have appeared, but it is clear that it is not going to stop.

Boulderton, a small community near the edge of the Crescent Wood is in need of scouts.  Rumors speak of Goblins on the run, Gnolls prowling the edge of town, lost tools, ancient puzzles, locked ruins, displaced Fae, and more.

Come join the adventure, gather some information, sell some wares, or just relax and have a good time!
