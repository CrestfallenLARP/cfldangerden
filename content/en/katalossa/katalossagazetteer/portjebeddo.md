## Katalossa Gazetteer



The Katalossa Gazetteer is a new publication started by me, Reyna, to tell everyone about Katalossa.  Lots of the books on this stuff have disappeared, which isn't the weirdest thing I have ever heard off.  Some of this may be rumors or things that happened in the past that local folks don't remember.  Luckily I have been around for awhile.  Magic does that to you.  Anywho, lets talk cities first!

## Port Jebeddo



Port Jebeddo is a beautiful port city on the North West portion of the continent and home to a majority of the Hauflin of Katalossa.  Once the home to an oppressive Magocracy, Jebeddo is now a bustling democracy focusing on honesty and integrity.  The Hauflin started the community in order to sort through the wreckage of an ancient floating city hundreds..... maybe thousands of years ago.  Using the technology and magic they found within the site, they were able to build sturdy homes of wood and metal.



## Landmarks



### The Lighthouse

The first and most important building within Port Jebeddo is my old home, the Lighthouse.  The building was originally created for the safety of ships traveling along the coast and within the bay nearby.  Crafted from a number of salvaged parts from the recycling fields, the lights have been burning for as long as I can remember.  The building was the hub of technology and magic for many years, housing a number of labs and testing facilities.  Sadly, due to a number of missteps on the part of the mages, the council was wiped out by a group of adventurers, leaving a power vacuum that brought about the democracy.  Currently the lighthouse still stands as a symbol of the Hauflins magical and technological heights, but also the folly of their hubris.  The lighthouse glows a beautiful and unnatural green light across the waters.  Its one of the prettiest things I have ever seen.





### Colosseum

The Colosseum is one of the most modern and the largest buildings in Jebeddo.  Originally built for the common Hauflin and their friends, the Colosseum was built for the growing sport of Hauflin Ball.  The game uses a round ball placed in the center of a rectangular sloped pool.  Goals are placed at both ends while 5 Hauflin teams propel themselves into the pool by laying on wooden boards with wheels attached.  The teams must use their skulls to propel the ball into the opposing teams goal while defending their own.  The team with the most points after 60 minutes is the victor.  Often times games were canceled due to numerous head and limb injuries.  Due to the overwhelming number of fatalities, the game became outlawed 100 years ago (Boo...).  Now the building is used to house plays, circuses, and musical events.  Once per year a Swap Meet is held where gathered, created, and found magical and technical marvels are traded or sold.  During this festival there is a vote for the years "Grand Invention".  The winner of the vote receives a magical essence.



## Groups



### Truth in the Trash

Raccoons love trash, but Raccoon Kinfolk find new meaning in it.  Raccoon-folk look through trash bins, cans, or any other kind of refuse to find the meaning behind things.  They aren't dirty.... in fact they are very clean about the situation.  Often just glancing at the items on top or shaking cans and bins to see what appears, they often are very intuitive about what is going on in an area.



### Diggers

There are a number of the common Hauflin folk that travel the rows and rows of debris from the fallen city looking for coins, metal, and technology.  Even now there are new wonders being found amidst the wreckage.  Sometimes dangers are unearthed, but more often than not, the lure of treasure is too much.



### Magical Studies

Even though the Magocracy ended many years ago, there are still a number of magically minded folks in Jebeddo.  Often times they studied the tomes and maps found in the Lighthouse, but those are all gone now.  Luckily a number of these intelligent Hauflin made their own copies of things, so I am sure a number of the books will be rewritten..... at some point.  Writing books takes a long time.



## Natural Wonders



The local area is home to a number of wonderful Alchemical items use for crafting poultices, solvents, coagulants, and my favorite.... brews.  The more drinks the better.

Additionally the local sea life and prime growing lands make gathering materials very easy to manage.



## Connection With The Inspired



Jebeddo is roughly 5 to 15 days travel from the Human capital city of Briarwood and 30 or more from the Dwarven hold of Zarn.  The Hauflin and Humans work very well together due to their combined love of Technology.  Additionally the Dwarves and Hauflin get along due to their interest in craft and alcohol.  The Hauflin and Raccoon-kin live together peacefully, but more predator based kinfolk often concern both groups.  The Hauflin do not interact with the Elves or Orc often, but do not show any particular hatred towards them.



## The End?

So.... yeah..... thats what I got.  I know more, but..... not sure what all would be important or what people would want to know.  Feel free to ask me some questions and I will try to uh..... conjure up some old memories.  Buy a round and I may be able to think of something quicker.  Tip and drinks are always welcome.  



Till next time,

Rayna
