Sightings of Goblinoid creatures have increased in the last few weeks. These increases are common with the cold weather setting in. According to our Adventurer sources these monsters do not gather or create items on their own, instead focusing on harvesting resources from local towns, farms, and the wandering adventurers. While not prone to killing, Goblins often knock targets unconscious in order to steal items, resources, and leaves.
