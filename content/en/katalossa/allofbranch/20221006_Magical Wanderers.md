Reports throughout Caernarthan, Korin Tal, Briarwood, Zarn, and Imshcran have been stating that travelers from other worlds have infiltrated the borders of many lineage strongholds. Many of these people arrive with little knowledge of where they have come from or where they are currently. The only memories that are clear for these travelers seem to be tied to strong emotional moments from their past such as great triumphs, follies, or joyous occasions. Most of these wanderers are of protected lineages, though some monsters have been found and quickly dispatched.

It is currently unclear as to why these people are randomly appearing. Rumors have swirled sighting attacks from our island neighbors to the North, though there is no corroborating evidence. Look forward to additional information in the coming editions.
