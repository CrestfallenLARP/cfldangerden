recap: During the 6th week of the Scatter, a magical tavern known as The Bearded Banshee appeared in Boulderton. Local residents and adventurers gathered within the tavern as the news of the Empyrean Conjunction drew in patrons. Visitors were welcomed with food, drink, games, and a mysterious constellation board. During the festivities, patrons were able to partake in Displacer Draught, a glowing green concoction that allowed the granted extra information and abilities to those who drank it. Using the constellation board allowed Benzihk, Ieyasu, Ephram, Xurd, and Keuyar to be chosen as paragons for the upcoming season until the next conjunction is completed. Benzihk grants Cover 1x per event or Search Harvesting 1x per event, Ephram grants Rune of Protection or 5 additional points of temporary armor, Ieyasu grants 5 basic build healing potions or 1x per event Stealth, Keuyar grants 5 additional body points but the player must wear visible scars or 1x diplomacy vs monsters, and Xurd causes the loss of 1 leaf resource or downtime or the character starts with the hexed condition.
