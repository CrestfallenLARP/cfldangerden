recap: |
  Explosions boomed over the countryside and fires raged in the caverns below the small village of Boulderton.   Gnolls bellowed as they ran, scorched by the inferno. The Undead, sensing their defeat channeled their magic to flee. With their plan ruined, the Shadow Brand slunk back into the darkness. The Goblins, without the element of surprise and their way into the bank vault detonated in advance, saw little use to continue a fight.
  
  The timed attacks were all foiled and Boulderton will remain safer for it. Thanks to the ideas and battles of the adventurers and the information passed along, the losses were minimal.
