synopsis:
  ...
  Harvesting teeth can be done on a three count, once per gnoll. The NPC will give one tooth per spawn. If the NPC doesn't have any teeth to give out, they can say 'Failed, Broken.'
  ...    
  
  There was a troll in a cave local to the town, now it's here in the city. Driven before the gnolls like an angry bull, the troll is bent on attacking anything in front of it.  In the wake of it's carnage, the gnolls are attacking the otherwise engaged adventurers. Limbs are being ripped and flesh is being eaten. The troll can be driven from the area and made to retreat. 

  If the troll is driven from the area, the gnolls will leave for a short time.  
   
outcomes: Troll is killed or driven off/gnolls attack the adventurers. When the troll is killed or driven off, the gnolls retreat
