synopsis: |
  ...
  Harvesting teeth can be done on a three count, once per gnoll. The NPC will give one tooth per spawn. If the NPC doesn't have any teeth to give out, they can say 'Failed, Broken.'
  ...   
  
  A Gnoll Spirit Shaman and the rest set up shop close but out of range of the adventurers. They can be engaged at any time during their set up and the ritual will be considered interrupted. Their goal is to complete The Breaking Ritual. The Breaking Ritual is a ritual that will shatter one limb on everyone in earshot of the final crack. The ritual takes 10 uninterrupted minutes to cast.
  
  The gnolls will enter the area carrying the containers of sand and the equipment for the ritual. They will draw a circle in sand, and set the bones inside (and outside if the circle is small). The gnoll shaman will 'cast' the spell, and at the end of 10 minutes, a loud crack will be heard (as well as a call of 'Voice, Knockdown, Destroy Limb') to signify the results of the spell.
  
  After everyone goes through their spawns, the NPCs will gather outside the fighting area, one will turn into a troll, and the next module starts right away.
