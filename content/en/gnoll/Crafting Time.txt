description: Ehrendil Gredove has come to the gathering hall to help those that stayed behind create a healing bracelet
 
synopsis: | 

  Those that did not wish to fight the gnolls have stayed behind and is making healing bracelets. The bracelets have 3 durability and heal '5 Body' and a 3 second roleplay of 'applying' the bracelet or rubbing it between the hands. The necklaces of gnoll teeth can be augmented in the same way.

  The healing objects are made by applying coats of healing wax, up to 3. Each 'coat' can be rubbed off on the skin to heal for 5 body. (So each object has 3 durability and can heal for '5 Body' per.)  
  
  The supplies are already in the gathering hall to do this, minus the balm.
  
  Ehrendil will augment gnoll teeth necklaces to do the same when the adventurers return. (Up to a total of 16 bracelets and necklaces).
