title: Rare Resource

post: We require a Rare Resource known as Nathanyalâ€™s Blood Iron. We have leads on the location of a piece of this Iron, but it is in a dangerous area inhabited by Gnolls. Travel to the area, acquire the Blood Iron, and return it for payment. If you do not have a Gatherer, one will be provided for you, but you must protect them. 
reward: 30 Leaves or value in recipes.
