  Timed Module:
  If this module is being ran, that means that the PCs have chosen to engage the gnolls as they run from the wagon wreckage. The PCs will have until noon to respond and follow. If they do not engage, the faction level of all gnolls spawning for the rest of the weekend will rise by one.
  
  The PCs will have 20 minutes from the end of 'Protect the Van' (from the time the last box is carried into the town and the gnolls retreat) to engage the gnolls or not. Timer will be paused when the PCs reach the mod building.
  ...

  Jacob Coldren, at the end of 'Protect the Van', has been successful in convincing the adventurers to go after the gnolls. He has made a plan and will help however the adventurers wish. He has the knowledge to know where the gnolls are heading, and can take the adventurers straight there.

  The gnolls are not retreating, but regrouping. The gnolls are headed to a bigger group, and the adventurers can chose to engage or not. The gnolls will try to make as many gnoll gluttons as possible.
