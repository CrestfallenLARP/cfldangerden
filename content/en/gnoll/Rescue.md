synopsis: | 
  ...
  Timed module:
  
  This module starts 30 minutes after the start of 'Gnoll Party', no matter what, and ends 60 minutes after that. Jacob's job when he enters is to convince the adventurers that his cause is more important, even in the middle of battle, and he needs to rescue the 4 people abducted quickly. Jacob is aware and can share that they have minutes to save these people. He does not know exact minutes, however. The longer it takes the adventurers to switch gears and go from defending to rescue mode, the more bodies stack up. Each person is killed at 10 minute intervals. So, one is killed at 40 minutes after Gnoll Party starts, one at 50 minutes, one at 60 minutes, and one at 70 minutes. Once everyone is dead, the gnolls remain in the area for 20 minutes after that. After the 90 minute mark from the start of 'Gnoll Party', the gnolls leave the area and are no longer able to be tracked and engaged. The gnolls will not chase the PCs when they retreat from the main fighting area with Jacob. They will leave when he does. 
  
  Depending on how many villagers are left alive/eaten dictates what 'Taken By Gnoll' posters are hung in the gathering hall after the mod by Jacob Coldren. Each eaten/killed villager gets their own poster.

  ...  
  
  Jacob and his crew fought off an attack of gnolls in the village outskirts while the adventurers fought off an attack of the gathering hall. The GMG were unsuccessful in repelling the gnolls completely, and the gnolls managed to abduct 4 people from the village and take them to a nearby area to feed on them. Jacob has left his crew to guard the village, and is asking the adventurers to quickly help retrieve the four captives before they are killed and eaten.

  Jacob takes whoever he convinced to come with him, and takes them on a short detour from the mod site and back. (or from mod site to the next mod site) 
  
  The gnolls follow the adventurers at a distance. (When Jacob leaves the area with the PCs, the NPCs who are engaging the left over PCs should finish up what they are doing and retreat to the shack (or go to the next mod site) until Jacob returns with the PCs. When he returns, the mod death timer is paused, and no more villagers will die. A Pause is called. The rest of the NPCs will be asked to come in if they are still out. The bodies of the villagers, marked dead or unconscious, are placed in the module area. The gnoll NPCs are directed to prowl around the bodies. The pause is lifted and the PCs engage the gnolls however they wish.)
  
  Once the gnolls are engaged, they will down, eat, and consume anyone that goes down with the goal of making several gnoll gluttons. They will not feed on a villager. A villager can be carried from the field just like any body (on a three count, both shoulders).

  The villagers with the dead condition can not be cured, and the unconscious condition will not end until the end of the fighting or until safe. If the PCs wish to talk with the rescued unconscious NPCs, they must make that desire known to mod, otherwise the villagers just wake, thank the PCs and leave.

running_notes: How this is going to work... When the gnolls attack the gathering hall at 8ish am, a timer will be started (0:00). At 0:30 Jacob Coldren will be sent in to talk to the PCs. It is his goal to get them to either 1. Win Faster to rescue villagers, 2. Retreat and rescue villagers, 3. Split Up, and rescue villagers, 4. Come up with a plan to rescue the villagers, while fighting. Once a plan is agreed upon, Jacob will lead the PCs down a set path, then back to the module area, to signify the chase of the gnolls (Or Jacob leads them from one mod site to the next). This can be taken at any speed the PCs wish. This time counts against the Village Dead Timer. (Once Jacob leaves with the PCs, the NPC gnolls are to retreat to the designated area to set up the next mod.) At 0:40 time, a gnoll will kill a villager. This will be signified by a tag being ripped that was placed around the dummy's neck. A green tag means the dummy is alive, a black tag means the dummy is dead. At :50, another villager will be killed and eaten if the timer is not interrupted. To interrupt the timer, the PCs will need to follow Jacob around the path, back to the mod area. Once back in the mod area, anyone who is on the mod will be placed in a pause, the death timer will be paused, and the next module set up. At :60 and :70, if the timer is not interrupted, a villager will be killed. If all the villagers are killed before Jacob can get the PCs to follow him, they have 20 minutes to kill the gnolls that remain in the area. If the PCs decide not to follow Jacob at all, all the villagers die and the gnolls retreat.
