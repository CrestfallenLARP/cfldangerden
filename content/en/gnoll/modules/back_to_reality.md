description: 10pmish. Jacob Coldren stumbles into the hall and has to face the consequences of his actions. The spirit of Ehrendil Gredove shows up in the hall after the gnolls leave the area to attempt to be resurrected. 
 
synopsis: |
  Jacob, unscathed, shakily enters into the hall. He hid when the gnolls attacked, and watched as the others got ripped apart. At some point, he passed out, and when he came to, he was alone. Stumbling through the dark, Jacob made his way to the only spot of light he could see, the gathering hall. 

  Ehrendil Gredove's spirit enters the hall to try to be resurrected. When and if she is, she comes back with a tale of when she and the others died, she saw a spirit shaman turn from corporal into a spirit, and then he consumed Howard and Azuk. He then chased her, until it finally left her alone (at the same time as 'Hold the Hall'.) She hid out until it was calm after the fighting, and she made her way to the gathering hall for help. 
  
  Both Jacob and Ehrendil stay in the hall and are available to RP with after the mod is over.
