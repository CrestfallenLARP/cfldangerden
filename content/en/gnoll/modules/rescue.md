  ...
  Timed module:
  
  This module starts 30 minutes after the start of 'Gnoll Party', no matter what, and ends 20 minutes after that. Jacob is to tell the PCs that they need to rescue the villagers and he needs to rescue the 4 people abducted quickly. Jacob is aware and can share that they have minutes to save these people. He does not know exact minutes, however. The longer it takes the adventurers to switch gears and go from defending to rescue mode, the more bodies stack up. Each person is killed at 5 minute intervals. So, one is killed at 35 minutes after Gnoll Party starts, one at 40 minutes, one at 45 minutes, and one at 50 minutes. Once everyone is dead, the mod will remain open for 'revenge' on the gnolls for 5 minutes. After the 55 minute mark from the start of 'Gnoll Party', the gnolls leave the area and are no longer able to be tracked and engaged.  
  
  Depending on how many villagers are left alive/eaten dictates what 'Taken By Gnoll' posters are hung in the gathering hall after the mod by Jacob Coldren. Each eaten/killed villager gets their own poster.

  ...
  
  Jacob and his crew fought off an attack of gnolls in the village outskirts while the adventurers fought off an attack of the gathering hall. GMG were unsuccessful in repelling the gnolls completely, and the gnolls managed to abduct 4 people from the village and take them to a nearby area to feed on them. Jacob has left his crew to guard the village, and is asking the adventurers to quickly help retrieve the four captives before they are killed and eaten.

  Jacob takes whoever he convinced to come with him, and takes them to the mod area.
  
  When Jacob leaves the area with the adventurers, the gnolls will follow. They will attack and harry the adventurers until they get to the feeding site, where the bodies of the villagers are, and a gnoll is there feasting.
  
  Each body is marked with a triage tag. The gnoll NPC will remove the 'Unconscious condition', one at a time on a body, at 35min, and will remove the 'Dying' condition at 36min, and follow through with the remaining bodies removing each tag at 40min/41min, 45min/46min, and 50min/51min and the gnolls will remain in area for 5 min after that.
  
  Once the gnolls are engaged at the feeding site, they will down, eat, and consume anyone that goes down with the goal of making several gnoll gluttons. They will not feed on a villager. A villager can be carried from the field by PC or NPC just like any body (on a three count, both shoulders).

  The villagers with the dead condition can not be cured, and the unconscious condition will not end until the end of the fighting or until safe one minute. If the PCs wish to talk with the rescued unconscious NPCs, they must make that desire known to mod, otherwise the villagers just wake, thank the PCs and leave. 
 
outcomes: 
 - Jacob Coldren convinces the PCs to join him quickly, the gnolls are defeated, and the villagers rescued 
 - Jacob Coldren is unsuccessful, and the villagers are eaten (1-4 losses).
