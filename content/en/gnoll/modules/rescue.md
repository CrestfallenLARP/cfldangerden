  Timed module:
  
  This module starts 5 minutes after the start of 'Gnoll Party', and ends 20 minutes after that. Ehrendil is to tell the PCs that they need to rescue the 4 people that were abducted, quickly. Ehrendil is aware and can share that they have minutes to save these people. 
  
  Each villager is killed at 5 minute intervals, then retains the dying condition for 5 minutes, in which they can be healed. If they are not healed or stabilized, then these villagers will die. These dead villagers get their very own poster.
  
  Mod will start a timer when Gnoll Party starts and keep track of dead/dying villagers. They will then call a pause when the PCs get to the mod site where the villagers are, and adjust Status Tags accordingly, and call Lay On. One villager is killed at 10 min, dead at 15. The next is killed at 15, dead at 20. Killed at 20, dead at 25. Killed at 25, dead at 30. The gnolls will leave after the last villager dies. The dying villagers will remain so until one minute after the fighting stops, then will be moved to dead, then has 5 minutes until they turn to spirit. The dead villagers have 5 minutes after the fighting stops, and then will turn to spirit.
  ...
  Ehrendil comes into the gathering hall. Jacob, Howard, and Azuk are off in the woods unable to be contacted, and the gnolls came to the village. They ran off with 4 people. Ehrendil is asking for help in rescuing the 4 people before the gnolls eat them. They don't have long before they are all dead.   
  
  After Ehrendil tells the adventurers what direction the other gnolls ran off to, the adventurers will start up the path. The gnolls will follow. They will attack and harry the adventurers until they get to the feeding site, where the bodies of the villagers are (mannequins).
  
  OOG- Follow Villager Status Tag Rules
  
  The gnolls will try to eat the villagers as they are being rescued, and will not waste an opportunity to rip into them. If a gnoll feeds from a villager, the gnoll can become a Gnoll Glutton just like any other feed. They can only feed from an unconscious person, and only once. It takes a 3 count to move the villager from 'unconscious' to 'dying' condition, and an uninterrupted 15 count (3 per limb, 3 per torso) to move from dying to dead condition. If the feed is interrupted, the villager is dying until healed and stabilized,  or one minute passes after the end of the fighting. They are then moved to the dead condition, and have 5 minutes to be healed or stabilized. 

  The gnolls will harry the adventurers up and down the hill back to the gathering hall while they have the bodies. Once in the gathering hall, the gnolls will lose interest and leave.  

  The villagers with the unconscious condition will wake at the end of the fighting or after they remain safe for one minute. Villagers with the dying condition can be stabilized and healed for one minute after the fighting stops, and villagers with the dead condition have 5 minutes to be cured. If the PCs wish to talk with the rescued unconscious NPCs, they must make that desire known to the Marshal, otherwise the villagers just wake, thank the PCs and leave.
