synopsis: |
  ...
  Timed module:
  
  This module starts 5 minutes after the start of 'Gnoll Party', and ends 20 minutes after that. Ehrendil is to tell the PCs that they need to rescue the 4 people that were abducted, quickly. Ehrendil is aware and can share that they have minutes to save these people. 
  
  Each villager is killed at 5 minute intervals, then retains the dying condition for 5 minutes, in which they can be healed, then will permanently die. Permanently dead villagers get their very own poster.
  
  Mod will start a timer when Gnoll Party starts and keep track of dead/dying villagers. They will then call a pause when the PCs get to the mod site where the villagers are, and adjust Status Tags accordingly, and call Lay On. One villager is killed at 10 min, dead at 15. The next is killed at 15, dead at 20. Killed at 20, dead at 25. Killed at 25, dead at 30. The gnolls will leave after the last villager dies.
  
  Bodies can be carried per the carry rules.
  ...
  Ehrendil comes into the gathering hall. Jacob, Howard, and Azuk are off in the woods unable to be contacted, and the gnolls came to the village, and they ran off with 4 people. Ehrendil is asking for help in rescuing the 4 people before the gnolls eat them. They don't have long before they are all dead.   
  
  When Ehrendil leaves the area with the adventurers, the gnolls will follow. They will attack and harry the adventurers until they get to the feeding site, where the bodies of the villagers are.
  
  Each body is marked with a Status Tag. When the PCs enter the mod area, a pause will be called, the Status tags adjusted according to time. Lay on will be called and the bodies either need to be stabilized or carried out of the area. Mod will time bodies with the dying condition and change the tag when appropriate. A villager can be carried from the field by PC or NPC just like any body (on a three count, both shoulders).
  
  The gnolls are trying to eat the villagers as they are being rescued, and will not waste an opportunity to rip into and eat them. If a gnoll feeds from a villager, the gnoll can become a Gnoll Glutton just like any other feed. They can only feed from an unconscious person, moving the tag to the dying condition, eating them on a 15 count (3 per limb, 3 torso). If the feed is interrupted, the person is still dying until healed and stabilized. If they are healed, they will remain unconscious until safe for one minute or back into the gathering hall.

  The gnolls will harry the adventurers up and down the hill back to the gathering hall while they have the bodies. Once in the gathering hall, the gnolls will lose interest and leave.  

  The villagers with unconscious condition will wake at the end of the fighting or after they remain safe for one minute. Villagers with the dying condition can be stabilized and healed, and villagers with the dead condition can not be cured. If the PCs wish to talk with the rescued unconscious NPCs, they must make that desire known to the Mod, otherwise the villagers just wake, thank the PCs and leave. 
 
outcomes: 
 - Ehrendil Graydove convinces the PCs to join her quickly, the gnolls are defeated, and the villagers rescued
