description: 9:30 am. Gno More Gnolls was not able to protect the caravan that was scheduled to enter town. The caravan was attacked by gnolls and essential supplies lay abandoned on the trail. It is up to the adventurers to carry in the equipment to the village... or not.
 
synopsis: | 
  There is a shipment on it's way into town, and Gno More Gnolls was hired by Paul&Paul, the father/son shipping company, to protect their caravan from the gnolls surrounding Boulderton. The wagons are loaded with essential, fragile equipment for the village laboratory, and must be seen to their destination. The adventurers will be paid on how much cargo makes it back to the village undamaged by Gno More Gnolls (1 Leaf per person per FULL sand line, 4 leaves per FULL container, no partial lines accepted)
   
  Unfortunately, because of the excitement of the morning with the gnolls, GMG were unable to make their contact with the wagons. The wagons (one driven by Paul and the other by Paul Jr) pressed on without their guard, for a reason only known to the Pauls. They were set upon by the gnolls and are now missing, presumed eaten. (After this mod, a member of the GMG hangs their 'Taken' Posters on the wall in the gathering hall)

  The crates that the wagons were carrying must be carried from the wreckage of the wagons, back to the gathering hall. Each crate can be carried by one person and picked up on a three count. If the player has the Strength skill, they no longer take a three count to lift the crate. If they have Strength Augmentation, they may jog with the crate, and no longer take a three count to lift the crate. If they have Strength Mastery, they may carry two crates, jog with one crate, and no longer take a three count to lift the crate. If at anytime the carriers are hit with an in game spell or damage, they will drop the crate. 
  
  The adventurers are directed by Jacob that the cargo is fragile, and will break if tipped or dropped. (Each crate is a cardboard box marked as a crate. Each box contains a container, an open 6qt plastic shoe box, full of sand. This sand box is taped to the bottom of the box. This is our hillbilly tip and shock indicator. Each plastic sand box is marked with three lines. How much sand is left in the containers dictates how much the PCs get paid)
  
  Once the cargo is carried to the gathering hall or onto the covered porch, the gnolls lose interest and retreat. 
  
  Jacob Coldren will recommend that that he and the adventurers chase after the gnolls. (If the PCs chase after the gnolls, run 'On Their Tails'. If the PCs choose to allow the gnolls to go unhunted, the entire faction and spawns gain a point for the weekend.) If they do not chase after the gnolls, run 'Report'.
  
outcomes: 
  - PCs carry the cargo while dodging gnolls for payment
