synopsis: The gnolls are hungry, and the adventurers are breakfast, wrapped and delivered. The gnolls will attack and feed until they make a gnoll glutton, until they are driven off by the adventurers, or until they run out of spawns. Attack for at least 30 minutes or until Jacob leaves with the adventurers, which ever comes first. Immediately runs into 'Rescue' module.
