synopsis: | 
  
  Jacob Coldren has to meet his team and is leaving the area. Before he does, however, he makes sure that he pays and finishes up anything from the morning excitement. He talks to the adventurers about taking them hunting for real after he his done making his rounds. Not everyone needs to go if they don't want to hunt, as Ehrendil Gredove will be coming back to help make a crafting item for those that stay behind. He says he will get those that go the teeth to make a necklace like his and his comrades. The supplies are already in the gathering hall. Alternately, Jacob can stay though lunch and take the adventurers out from there.
 
  Jacob and company are collecting information on the gnolls while hunting them, to make hunting them easier for everyone. Jacob will ask and collect any information the adventurers wish to give, add his own observations if he wishes, and then leaves. Before he leaves, Jacob will remind the adventurers that the research guild might pay for any research before he leaves.
  
  Things to report include, but are not limited to, abilities seen in gnolls, habits, quirks, language or vocalizations, number of injuries, number of dead, and number of gnoll that attacked, etc.
