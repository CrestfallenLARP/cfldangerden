synopsis: | 
  
  Jacob Coldren talks to the adventurers about taking them hunting for real after he his done making his rounds during lunch. Not everyone needs to go if they don't want to hunt, as Ehrendil Gredove will be here to help make a crafting item for those that stay behind. He tells the adventurers he will get those that go with him, the teeth to make a necklace like his and his comrades. The supplies are already in the gathering hall.
 
  Ehrendil Gredove is collecting information on the gnolls to make hunting them easier for everyone. She preaches all the (incorrect) information that is contained within the pamphlet 'Gknow Your Gnolls, A Guide By Gno More Gnolls'. She is also there to take any information from the adventurers on the gnolls. Things to report include, but are not limited to, abilities seen in gnolls, habits, quirks, language or vocalizations, number of injuries to adventurers, number of dead adventurers, and number of gnoll that attacked, number of killed gnolls, number of gluttons made, etc.
