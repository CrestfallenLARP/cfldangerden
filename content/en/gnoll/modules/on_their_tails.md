synopsis: | 
  ...
  Timed Module-
  If this module is being ran, that means that the PCs have chosen to engage the gnolls as they linger by the wagon wreckage. If the PCs do not engage in 10 minutes from the end of "Protect The Van", the gnolls will be gone and five more missing posters will be hung in the hall by GMG. The NPCs will wait for 10 minutes after "Protect The Van" on a path not far from the wagon wreckage. 
  ...

  Jacob Coldren, having missed the hard work, is insistent that the PCs go after the gnolls swiftly, while Ehrendil takes inventory at the gathering hall. If Jacob or Ehrendil can convince the adventurers to go after the gnolls, Jacob will take them there. There are very few straggler gnolls by the wagon wreckage.

  Jacob needs to take extreme pleasure from the group killing the gnolls. It's almost uncomfortable (see card)
