synopsis: |
  ...
  Harvesting teeth can be done on a three count, once per gnoll. The NPC will give one tooth per spawn. If the NPC doesn't have any teeth to give out, they can say 'Failed, Broken.'
  ...     
  
  Dinner is concluded by the sounds of screams coming from the direction of the village proper (Gnoll Laughter and Screams). When the source is investigated, the adventures find there are bodies and parts everywhere. No one was spared. Nothing was visually consumed, and the slaughter looks like what would happen if a mink got into a hen house, or a dog in a chicken pasture (meaning they had fun). There are no more gnolls left in the area when the group arrives.
  
  Gno More Gnolls shows up in force. They were patrolling and heard the screaming. If the adventurers do not investigate the source on their own, GMG will come into the hall, get the adventurers, and take them to the screaming.

  Ehrendil asks for help and starts to collect the bodies and counting the slain. Whole bodies are marked dead. Jacob plans with the rest of his group, and includes the adventurers in his hunting plans. Howard and Azuk are with whatever Jacob wants to do.

  Jacob will recommend that they all meet in 10 minutes at the head of the trail. Starts 'Fight The Good Fight'.  
   
outcomes: Jacob plans with his group to wipe out the gnolls, once and for all.
