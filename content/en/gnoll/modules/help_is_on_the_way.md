schedule: saturday early afternoon
weight: 10
plotline: Gnoll - Main
requirements: 

description: 6pm. Screams are heard from the direction of the village. Gno More Gnolls races into town.
 
synopsis:
  ...
  Harvesting teeth can be done on a three count, once per gnoll. The NPC will give one tooth per spawn. If the NPC doesn't have any teeth to give out, they can say 'Failed, Broken.'
  
  Print out of body parts can be used to help bulk out the needed sfx props.
  ...     
  
  Dinner is concluded by the sounds of screams coming from the direction of the village (One minute sound effect). When the source is investigated, there are bodies and parts everywhere. No one was spared. Nothing was consumed, and the slaughter looks like what would happen if a mink got into a hen house, or a dog in a chicken pasture (meaning they had fun). There are no more gnolls left in the area when the group arrives.
  
  Gno More Gnolls shows up in force. They were patrolling and heard the screaming.

  Ehrendil starts to collect the bodies and counting the slain. Jacob plans with his group, and includes the adventurers in his hunting plans. Howard and Azuk are with whatever Jacob wants to do.

  Howard has the ability to track the gnolls, and leads the group to the gnolls in 'Fight The Good Fight'  
   
outcomes: Jacob plans with his group to wipe out the gnolls, once and for all.
