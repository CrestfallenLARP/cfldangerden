synopsis: |
   Gno More Gnolls throws a large party to celebrate the end of the hunt. Gno More Gnolls shill for themselves and Jacob takes all the credit for the weekend's events. 
   - GMG hand out pendants as business cards of sorts. When the pendants are given out a shot glass is placed on the table and filled with a thick hard whisky from Boulderton. When the shot is drank Jacob will say "Welcome to the wolf pack" and place the pendant on their neck.
   - Drinks are flowing freely. GMG has mead provided by Ehrendil that is poured out on large shot glass trays. A toast is said when doing the drinks. There is sparkling wine by an Elven winery and regular punch as well.
   - Jacob gives a speech about the town and how in honor of Teduardo, his father Giles Coldren has provided a large sign to be hung in the tavern. 
   - Any of the hired roleplay players such as Oz give their small presentations.
