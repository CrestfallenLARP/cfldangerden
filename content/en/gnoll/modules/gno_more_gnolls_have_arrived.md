synopsis: |
  Gno More Gnolls, a gnoll bounty hunter group, has been contacted and hired by the mayor to eradicate the local gnoll problem. They are quite cruel in their ways, but do not see a problem with it. They are effective, doing a job no one else wants. When Jacob sees the newly arrived adventurers, he is ecstatic! He recruits for 'Protect The Van' the following day, leaving Howard, Azuk, and Ehrendil to defend the town. He says Ehrendil will be coming by periodically to take and share any notes on the gnolls, and teach some healing crafting.
  
  Gno More Gnolls have printed up posters with the missing, plus descriptions, and would like the adventurers to take them, and/or hang them up in the hall for everyone to read.
  
  GMG is interested in collecting any observed information from the adventurers about the gnolls. Things to report include, but are not limited to, abilities seen in gnolls, habits, quirks, language or vocalizations, number of injuries, number of Inspired dead, and number of gnoll that have attacked, number of dead gnolls, etc.
  
  Gno More Gnolls is being paid 400 leaves by the mayor, plus whatever loot they find, to clear the area of gnolls.
