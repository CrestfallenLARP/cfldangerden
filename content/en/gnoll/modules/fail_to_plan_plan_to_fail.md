description: 4:30pm. Jacob Coldren makes a plan with the adventurers to hunt the gnolls at around dusk, when they bed down for the day. Ehrendil Gredove takes a report of information.
 
synopsis: Jacob Coldren and Ehrendil Gredove finally make their way to the hall with fantastical tales of fighting of the gnolls while they attacked the hall, to sit with the adventurers to discuss a hunting strategy for the gnolls and to take any notes. Jacob will strongly suggest going after them at dark or after, so they are bedded down for the day. The gnolls will constantly interrupt this process. The gnolls seem to target Ehrendil like they hate her (see card).
 
outcomes: Jacob Coldren makes a plan with the adventurers, Ehrendil Gredove takes notes, and they leave when done
