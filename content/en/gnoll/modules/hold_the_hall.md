synopsis: |
  ...
  Harvesting teeth can be done on a three count, once per gnoll. The NPC will give one tooth per spawn. If the NPC doesn't have any teeth to give out, they can say 'Failed, Broken.'
  ... 
  
  The gnolls retreated to go get the shamans. The shamans return, drumming their drum, and set up shop within hearing distance. The gnolls want to destroy the adventurers, and in order to do so, are aiming to cast another Breaking Ritual. The gnoll gluttons are to protect the shamans. If the gnolls successfully cast a Breaking Ritual, the gnoll gluttons will feed on as many people as possible. If anyone goes to spirit at anytime, the gnoll shaman is to go to spirit and try to consume them.
