synopsis: | 

  *The following are optional to play. They serve no purpose other than for an NPC to have something to do.*

  A member of the research guild, Edward Carver, has been trapped in the town for days because of the gnolls. Edward Carver views the newly arrived hunting group, Gno More Gnolls, with contempt. He views them as incompetent and inefficient, and not worth the price he was 'extorted' to fund their arrival. He has come to offer what information they have about the gnolls, to the newly arrived, in hopes of saving their lives. He has no actual helpful information, as most of what he knows of the gnolls he either read it 1. From Oz, or 2. Personal and bad observation

  A villager, Alex Barber, has come into the hall to just mingle. They are terrified of the gnolls and will gladly share the horror of living in fear of them every day.
  
  A villager, Nova Trinder, comes into town to see if anyone has seen their husband/wife, (their poster is on the wall marked 'Taken, Assumed Dead Fifth day of the eighth week'). The husband/wife were taken by the gnolls and the spouse in denial about their fate. They will break down in hysterics if the matter is pushed. 
  
  The tavern keep, Danny Cook, laments the fact that they had to shut down because large gatherings were gnoll bait. Their wife, Margery Cook, has been missing since the Second Day of the eighth week of the Scatter.
