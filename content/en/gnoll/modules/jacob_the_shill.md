synopsis: | 
  Jacob Coldren is in the hall schmoozing the adventurers and locals. He is shilling for his company, bragging about how 'he plays the drums', flaunting his money, just all around kinda being a butt hole. Jacob's ego is off the charts, he thinks he and his company can do no wrong. He has no respect for the gnolls. He also can't stop talking about his party that they are throwing when the gnolls are cleared from the area.
  
  Jacob will attempt to hire any vendor or anyone with a table. He will ask Oz to do a card reading at the party the next day, to foretell the prosperous future of Gno More Gnolls. He will ask for alcohol from anyone who can make it, to serve the next day at the party. He will brag on the menu (Macaroni Salad, Hawaiian Meatballs, Kielbasa & Potatoes in cheese sauce, BBQ Chicken, Beef Stew, Green Beans/Potatoes w/lilsmokies, Eclair Cake, Sparkling Red, White, Cider, and Mead). He will brag on his music prowess, and say that he is working on a surprise for everyone at the party (his rap). 
  
outcomes: Jacob successfully shills for Gno More Gnolls
