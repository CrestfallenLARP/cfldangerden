  Jacob Coldren is in the hall schmoozing the adventurers and locals. He is shilling for his company Gno More Gnolls, bragging about how well 'he plays the drums', flaunting his money, just all around kinda being a butt hole.

He also can't stop talking about his party that they are throwing when the gnolls are cleared from the area.
