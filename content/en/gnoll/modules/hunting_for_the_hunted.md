description: The gathering hall has become the base for Gno More Gnolls.  15-20 'Taken By Gnoll' posters, printed by Gno More Gnolls, are hung with details of who and where they were abducted, and if anything (or any part) was ever recovered.  
 
synopsis: | 

  The gathering hall is currently being used by Gno More Gnolls as a base to hunt the gnolls.

  On the inside of the gathering hall are 15-20 posters hung with the name, description, date of abduction, and any tracking or pertinent information on those that have been taken by the gnolls. There are also beds, and the personal effects of Gno More Gnolls, the gnoll hunter group. They are responsible for the posters appearance. It looks like they have been using the gathering hall as a staging area to look for the missing and tracking the gnolls. 
   
outcomes: Information on missing people is relayed.
