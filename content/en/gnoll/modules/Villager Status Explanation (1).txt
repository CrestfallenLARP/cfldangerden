Unconsious, Dying, Dead

We are short on NPCs, and this event we wish to try to give the feel of a large town by using dolls and mannequins to represent villagers. These mannequins or dolls will have one of three tags showing, letting you know the condition of the villager. These tags will either say 'unconscious', 'dying', or 'dead'.

An unconscious villager is just that, unharmed but unconscious. They are fine, but they will not move or speak. They can be carried using a three count just like a regular person, using the carry rules. They can be fed upon or killed by NPCs. If an NPC feeds from or kills an unconscious villager, the NPC will remove the unconscious tag (giving the marshal the tag), revealing the dying or dead tag.

A dying villager will remain in the dying condition for as long as there is fighting in the area. If they are moved, they have one minute from being moved out of the fighting area before they are dead. The dying villager can be saved during this time by healing or stabilizing the villager. If a PC heals or stabilizes a villager, the 'unconscious' tag for that villager can be retrieved from the marshal either during or after the fight.  Once fighting stops, a dying villager has one minute to be healed or stabilized before the dying tag is removed, and they become dead.  

A dead villager is dead, and can be cured using in game skills while the fighting is happening. If the villager retains the dying condition, the villager will become a spirit 5 minutes after the fighting in the area stops, or 5 minutes after they are carried out of the fighting area.
