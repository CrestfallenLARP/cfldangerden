synopsis: | 
  ...
  If gnoll shamans are made during 'Fight The Good Fight', one or several (up to three) Breaking Rituals will be attempted during the fight.
  The rituals will already be set up. The ritual will start when the PCs get within fighting distance. If the shaman NPC is hit or interrupted at any time during casting, the ritual will fail and will not be reattempted.
  ... 
  The gnolls are ready for the adventurers. A large group of gnolls are at the end of the path, rituals set up, ready to go. Interrupt the rituals, kill or drive off the gnolls, and end the scourge in the area.
  
  The gnolls will pull their punches and retreat before absolutely winning.
