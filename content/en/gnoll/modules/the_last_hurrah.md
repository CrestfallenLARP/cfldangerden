synopsis: | 
  ...
  Several (up to three) Breaking Rituals will be attempted during the fight. The ritual will already be set up, up the path. The ritual will start when the PCs get within hearing distance. If the shaman NPC dies at any time during casting, that shamans ritual cast will fail and will not be reattempted. If they are interrupted and not killed, they will awaken and reattempt the ritual, starting the 10 minute timer over. Harvesting teeth can be done on a three count, once per gnoll. The NPC will give one tooth per spawn. If the NPC doesn't have any teeth to give out, they can say 'Failed, Broken.'
  ... 
  This module takes place a little further away from the location of 'Fight the Good Fight'.
  
  The gnolls are ready for the adventurers, and have a plan of sorts. They are attempting to cast Breaking Rituals while the rest hold off the adventurers. The ritual will be attempted 3 times (a gnoll shaman dies, dissipates, and 'another' takes it's place). If the PCs take the human bones, no more rituals can be attempted. If a PC dies and goes to spirit, the gnoll shaman will abandon the ritual and go to spirit, and chase after the spirit to consume it.
  
  Once all the gnoll spirit shamans are dead, the gnolls will retreat into the woods/down the trail.
