requirements: They're Dead! ran

description: 9:05pm Screams can be heard in the distance as the villagers run to the hall to seek shelter and protection (pt. 1 final fight)
 
synopsis: |
  ...
  The villagers (dolls with Status tags) are carried into the hall by OOG NPCs. The NPCs will set the dolls up around the edges of tables, on chairs, etc. The NPCs should leave, and return as gnolls when needed. When the villagers are set up, all villagers will be considered unconscious (tagged as such). They will follow villager status rules. If a villager goes to spirit, roll a die. If it is above 40/100, the spirit shows up in the hall to resurrect.
  Harvesting teeth can be done on a three count, once per gnoll. The NPC will give one tooth per spawn. If the NPC doesn't have any teeth to give out, they can say 'Failed, Broken.' 
  ...
  
  Screams are heard following the arrival, and departure, of Wilson Ryder. Villagers start to run into the building. 20 villagers arrive and then the screaming stops. (The NPCs go off screen, get gnolled up, and wait.) Outside, the drumming starts. Gnoll laughter starts.

  The gnolls gather on the edge of the playing area. The gnolls approach the door, and toss in 3 heads of Gno More Gnolls (Ehrendil, Howard, and Azuk), along with other body parts and a Shadowbrand tag. The gnolls retreat back, and try to draw out the adventurers and away from the villagers. The gnoll's goal is to kill the villagers. The gnolls will run into the hall, abduct (following carrying rules) and/or feed on a villager. If the gnolls feed on the villager for a 15 count they become gnoll gluttons. 

  Once all the villagers are dead (or 15 minutes, which ever is first), drumming will start calling the gnolls away, and the gnolls will stop attacking and retreat, leaving the area for a short time.
  
  The adventurers have 10 minutes to heal, make safe, and escort the villagers out (marshal and NPCs remove dolls)
