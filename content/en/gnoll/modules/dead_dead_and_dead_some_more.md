synopsis: |
  ...
  The villagers (dolls with Status tags) are carried into the hall by OOG NPCs. The NPCs will set the dolls up around the edges of tables, on chairs, etc. The NPCs should leave, and return as gnolls when needed. When the villagers are set up, all villagers will be considered unconscious (tagged as such). They can be moved by carrying per the rules. If a gnoll can feed from a villager once, the gnoll should remove the 'unconscious tag', revealing the 'dying' tag. The villager can be healed, during or up to one minute after the fight, and the 'unconscious' tag retrieved from the marshal after the fight, saving that villager. If the gnoll can feed for a uninterrupted 15 count (3 per limb, 3 for torso) they need to remove the 'dying' tag, leaving the 'dead' tag. The villager is now dead. They will have to be resurrected, if the spirit shows up (40 or above die roll). No villager can be fed on more than once (all or nothing). Harvesting teeth can be done on a three count, once per gnoll. The NPC will give one tooth per spawn. If the NPC doesn't have any teeth to give out, they can say 'Failed, Broken.' 
  ...
  
  Screams are heard following the arrival, and departure, of Wilson Ryder. Villagers start to run into the building. 20 villagers arrive and then the screaming stops. (The NPCs go off screen, get gnolled up, and wait.) Outside, the drumming starts. Gnoll laughter starts.

  The gnolls gather on the edge of the playing area. The gnolls approach the door, and toss in 3 heads of Gno More Gnolls (Ehrendil, Howard, and Azuk), along with other body parts. The gnolls show tactics and retreat back, and try to draw out the adventurers and away from the villagers. The gnoll's goal is to kill the villagers. The gnolls will run into the hall, abduct (following carrying rules) and/or feed on a villager. If the gnolls feed on the villager for a 15 count they become gnoll gluttons. 

  Once all the villagers are dead (or 15 minutes, which ever is first), drumming will start calling the gnolls away, and the gnolls will stop attacking and retreat, leaving the area for a short time.
  
  Any villagers with the 'unconscious' condition at the end of one minute from the end of fighting, wake up in five minutes and are saved and leave.
