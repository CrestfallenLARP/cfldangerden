synopsis: |
  ...
  The villagers are represented by dolls. Each doll is one villager. Each doll is fitted with a triage tag. This tag signifies if the villager is alive or not. When the villagers are taken and killed, the NPC will remove the tag and give it to the marshal (alternate, if the head is removable, the head should be removed and given to the marshal) 
  ...
  
  Screams are heard following the arrival of Wilson Ryder. Villagers start to run into the building (dolls carried by NPCs that are out of game). Screams continue to be heard while the villagers enter the hall. 20 villagers arrive and then the screaming stops. Then the drumming starts.

  The gnolls surround the hall, jeering, hollering, and taunting. They are carrying body parts and start throwing them at the entrance to the hall. 

  Gnolls approach the door, and toss in the 4 heads of Gno More Gnolls, along with other body parts. They retreat to the group, and try to draw out the adventurers, away from the villagers. The gnoll's goal is to kill the villagers, along with the adventurers. The gnolls will run into the hall, abduct (following carrying rules) or kill a villager, and then leave (will only kill one at a time). The villagers will remain 'dying' as long as there is fighting going on. A villager can be healed, and the tag (head) retrieved from the marshal to put back on the doll. Once the fighting stops (for one minute), the villagers without tags will die and not be able to be healed.

  Once all the villagers are dead (or 10 minutes, which ever is first), drumming will start, and the gnolls will stop attacking and retreat to the edge of the fighting area.
