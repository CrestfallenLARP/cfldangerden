  ...
  Harvesting teeth can be done on a three count, once per gnoll. The NPC will give one tooth per spawn. If the NPC doesn't have any teeth to give out, they can say 'Failed, Broken.'
  ...
  Azuk, the muscle of GMG, has scouted the area and has found several gnoll "camps". These camps are scattered around the whole of Boulderton. Azuk has made a list, detailing where each camp is, and has left it in the hall with these instructions- If the adventurers wish to clear out a gnoll camp, Azuk will pay 20 leaves per gnoll camp cleared. Any treasure found while clearing out the camp can be kept. If you clear out a camp, cross out and then sign under the camp cleared.

  Azuk will come in periodically to check the list, pay out anything outstanding, mark off his progress, and then leave to return to hunting.
