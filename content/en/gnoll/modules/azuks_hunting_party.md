description: Azuk, the brawn of Gno More Gnolls, has been instructed by Jacob to take hunting parties with him when he goes off and fights the gnolls. 
 
synopsis: |
  ...
  Harvesting teeth can be done on a three count, once per gnoll. The NPC will give one tooth per spawn. If the NPC doesn't have any teeth to give out, they can say 'Failed, Broken.'
  ...
  
  Azuk has been told by Jacob to stop hunting by himself, and to at least take a few able bodied persons with him when he hunts. The hunts are at random times, to random places, and may not occur at all. OOG- These hunts serve as time filler, something to do (instead of randoms), and for a chance to improvise with the players. If the hunts take place after 'A Toothless Gnoll', the gnoll will give out teeth as well.
