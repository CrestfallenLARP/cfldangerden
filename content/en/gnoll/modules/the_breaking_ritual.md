plotline: Gnoll- Main
requirements: 

description: 4pm. After turning their brethren into toothless corpses, the Gnoll Shamans have set up camp in a ritual circle, with the intent on shattering bone. If the 10 minute ritual is complete, everyone within hearing distance breaks one limb of their choosing. GMG is nowhere to be found.
 
synopsis: |
  ...
  Harvesting teeth can be done on a three count, once per gnoll. The NPC will give one tooth per spawn. If the NPC doesn't have any teeth to give out, they can say 'Failed, Broken.'
  ...   
  
  A Gnoll Spirit Shaman and the rest set up shop close but out of immediate range of the adventurers. The Shamans can be engaged at any time and the ritual will be considered interrupted. Their goal is to complete The Breaking Ritual. The Breaking Ritual is a ritual that will shatter one limb on everyone in earshot of the final cracks(oog- cap gun shot). The ritual takes 10 uninterrupted minutes to cast. If the shaman completes the spell, the gnolls descend upon the injured and feast. 
  
  The gnolls will enter the area carrying the equipment for the ritual. They will set the bones around them. The gnoll shaman will 'cast' the spell, and at the end of 10 minutes, a loud crack will be heard (as well as a call of 'Voice, Knockdown, Destroy Limb') to signify the results of the spell.
  
  The glutton's goal in this instance is to protect the shaman, then eat the adventurers. If the shaman dies, the gnolls will retreat.
  
  After everyone goes through their spawns, the NPCs will return to the shack, one NPC turns into a troll, and the gnolls return to the gathering hall in 'They Have A Troll'.
