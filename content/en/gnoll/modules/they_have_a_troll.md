synopsis:
  ...
  Harvesting teeth can be done on a three count, once per gnoll. The NPC will give one tooth per spawn. If the NPC doesn't have any teeth to give out, they can say 'Failed, Broken.'
  ...    
  
  There was a troll in a cave local to the town, now thanks to the gnolls, it's here in the hall. Driven before the gnolls like an angry bull, they drive the troll into the hall and shut the doors behind it. They will watch the troll wreak havoc through the door, and will run when it dies and/or if they draw attention to themselves.
