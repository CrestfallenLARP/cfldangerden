synopsis: |
  Gno More Gnolls, a bounty hunter group, has been contacted and hired by the locals to eradicate the local gnoll problem. When they arrived to the isolated, but thriving town, they realized the problem was way out of their level. Not wanting to die, but not wanting to admit defeat and lose a paycheck, the leader of Gno More Gnolls has come to the gathering hall to see if the newly arrived adventurers can help clear out the gnolls. 
  
   They are being paid an additional 100 leaves by the locals, plus whatever loot they find, to clear the area of gnolls.
  
  Also, while there, they are to recruit help for 'Protect the Van' at 10am the next day. The group is interested in collecting any observed information from the adventurers about the gnolls. Things to report include, but are not limited to, abilities seen in gnolls, habits, quirks, language or vocalizations, number of injuries, number of dead, and number of gnoll that attacked, etc. 
      
outcomes: Gno More Gnolls member(s) talk to the adventurers, get them on board with eradicating the gnolls, giving them the lay of the land, what's going on, defend themselves from Edward's accusations, and just shoot the breeze for one hour, or until they get tired.
