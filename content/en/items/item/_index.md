Needs:  

* Searchable for Name, Type, Created By, Character Number

* Allowable types are Alchemy, Forging, Enchanting, and Scientific.  There are some cards that may have multiple types.  I am ok with symbols if necessary for space.

* Be able to add to write ups and folders areas

* Be easily added to a printable layout for Print on Demand site

* Need to know how many items we must print at one time for a full sheet.

* Should use the art we already have available

* Each event I want to print at least 2 full sheets of item cards between the folders and items going out on modules

* PC made cards will be hand written on the current business cards until we are out of them.

* PC made cards that are planned ahead of time can be printed in the runs before events

* This can be a list that is sortable like the monsters on the Polar site

* What is the lead time required to print these pages and have them arrive. About 2 weeks. 

  



Event planning use case -

While planning my events I need 4 to 5 items per lineage and guild and at least one item per 5 players per game day (minimum 4 per game day) to be distributed during adventures during the course of the event.  Current average items needed per one day is 44.  This should be 2 Sheets of 24 cards per sheet in typical business card size 2x3.5.  15.50 for two sheets, 7.15 for shipping, 3.99 for insurance, 26.64 for two sheets per event. 55.5cents per card

If matte premium black core 21.04 for 44 cents per

Mini Cards are 1.75 x 2.5 and net 36 cards per sheet allowing up to 72 items on 2 sheets 26.64 is 37 cents per card

if matte premium black core 21.04 for 29.2 cents per

I am leaning towards the mini cards on the plastic backing.  This nets us almost two events worth of items in one print job.  Additionally, if I can prepare the items ahead of time, we can get even better pricing overall as after 5 pages there is a per page discount.

I could easily have 1 page of the following items printed Common One Handed Weapon, Common Two Handed Weapon, Common Shield, Common Buckler, Common Armor.

Following this, I can add one or two events worth of items if I can get them done ahead of time.  This would be 9 pages at 64.17, with 7.15 for shipping, 3.99 for insurance, for a total of 75.31/324 cards for 23.3 cents per card

For maximum savings, each order should be at least 5 pages.  The shipping and insurance are the same from 1 to 10 pages. 82.44/ 360 is 22.9 cents per card

As discussed during our discord discussion, I am fine with a reformatting of the card to reduce wasted space.  Removing the ITEM CARD at the top and the date from the cards are acceptable.  Additionally, If you want the boxes to be generated, that is also ok.  The max number of boxes is 32.
