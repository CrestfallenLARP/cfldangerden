Wands are a separate use case.  These items are on tongue depressors.  I would like these items to be generated on a separate document that I can use to print, cut, and tape to the wand reps (like NERO components) with the following information. 

### Side  1

Crestfallen LARP, Single Use Wand, Created By, Character Number, Date. 

**Side 1 Example**: Crestfallen LARP, Single Use Wand, Beren Olean, 1, 8/12/23

### Side 2 

Spell Incant. 

*Side 2 Example*: By my frigid ex's breath 5 Ice

I don't believe that the headings are necessary for side one, just the information.  Paper can be up to 3 inches wide and should be 3/4 of an inch high per side with 1/16th of an inch between for the fold.
