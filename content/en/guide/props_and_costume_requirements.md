title: Props and Costume Requirements
---

Please treat all props and costumes as if they were your own. Do not misuse or mistreat our items as that has an impact on event costs.

If something needs washed or cleaned before being used again, let us know. We will put it in a different location to make sure it is cleaned and sanitized before being used again.

Put items back where they belong after use. Weapons should be placed handle side down in containers. Latex weapons should be laid flat on surfaces without lying on other items. 

Shield should be stacked. Items in bins should be replaced in their bins.

Cleaning as we go will help safe time and space during clean up.

Can't use a mask? Ask for assistance with makeup or another alternative.

Need help with masks? We will do the best we can. Some are more difficult to use than others.

Its always good to have a piece of flair that makes your character different from others. Feel free to bring something or borrow something. Armor, bags, and other props are great for this.
