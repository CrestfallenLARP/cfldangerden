Mental Safety
Take care of yourself first! Your health and well being are more important than the game. This is often more important to remember for mental safety than physical safety.
Keep a positive energy - We are the face of the event and have to hold ourselves to a high standard.
Don’t discuss other games, running teams, or nostalgia - We need to focus on the current event, not our past. Often times these discussions are not helpful and start to bring down the energy of what is currently going on. This is different if the event calls for some nostalgia, but should be kept to that particular topic. (There is downtime and after event time for the nostalgia to come out)
Promote good sportsmanship - Be respectful of all players to the best of your ability. Don’t take part in, condone, or enable bad behavior. If there is something unsportsmanlike going on
If you notice something, say something to the staff members the item would most concern. Rules Issues - Rules Marshall. Plot Issues - Plot Team. Interpersonal Issues - One PC side staff and one NPC side staff.
