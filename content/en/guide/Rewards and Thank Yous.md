title: Rewards and Thank Yous
---

First and foremost, thank you so much for NPCing with us. We want you to know that we appreciate you and all of your hard work. Often we are so wrapped up in running events that it is difficult to remember to say all of the things that we wish to say.
It takes so much effort to tell these stories and we are glad that you are here for the ride. We hope that you have gotten to play fun characters, had great battles, and interacted with wonderful players.
We know this won’t always be the case. If you had a rough time and need to talk to someone about it, please do it now. Don’t wait until you are home. We want to make sure that you had fun, and if you didn’t, we need to know sooner rather than later. We can’t fix problems that we don’t know about and some problems take longer to fix than others.
We want this to be fun for all.

As a thank you for NPCing, you will get the following towards future play at Crestfallen
For One Day Events you will receive 4CP towards a character, 5 leaves, and 1 basic resource.
For Weekend Events you will get to play your character on Friday and Sunday if you wish. Additionally you will receive 8CP towards a character, 10 leaves, 2 basic resources, and a $10 credit towards a PC event.
Eventually we would like to thank NPCs and Authors in other ways such as with shirts, buttons, rulebooks, item tags, and more. If you have suggestions, email us at Crestfallenlarp@gmail.com and we will review items at the next symposium.
Thank you again, and we look forward to gaming again soon!
