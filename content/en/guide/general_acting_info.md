title: General Acting Info
---

**Act with confidence** - Feel free to build on the character and make it your own. Have a name, occupation, family, local home, hobbies, etc. If you are worried about messing up a plot point, then make the important details for the character be small things. Example: You are told that you are a local farmer. What do you grow? What family do you have? What do you do for fun? Don’t adlib being a bad guy, a law breaker, or similar things that will lead to complex acting unless plot directs you to do so.

**Character Knowledge** - If you don’t know something, then your character most likely doesn’t know it either. If you feel the character should, ask a plot team member before playing the role or ask for clarification if the info was overlooked. Don’t be afraid to call a pause and ask for a staff member if the acting is important to you or other players.

**Secrecy** - You will learn things while running the event that are intended to be secret from the players. This is not information that your character should know or that all of your NPCs will know. Sometimes you will need to “Play Dumb” when you eventually PC. If you are ever concerned regarding this, ask a plot member for some guidance to make sure you understand what your character may or may not know.

**Play to lift** - Try to help other players and character become involved in the story as much as possible. Sometimes we will see players that are shy or new struggle to get involved. Pull them into the overarching story of the weekend and get them involved.

**Play to the card** - The characters and monsters that NPCs played should be written out and explained in some fashion. If you need assistance in direction, as a plot team member. You should never play to the best of your combat abilities at all times.

**Yes, And** - This style of acting is used heavily by the plot members. Many NPCs do not feel empowered to use this type of acting method as they do not wish to ruin the written story of the event. If a player or the NPC have an item that they feel could be used and built upon for the story, please talk with a plot member and we will do our best to facilitate these types of interactions.
