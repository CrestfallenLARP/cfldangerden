title: Expectations of NPCs
---
We want to be transparent regarding our expectations of NPCs. If you are ever unclear what what you should be doing, what you could be doing, or if we are happy/unhappy with your actions as an NPC, let us know.

NPCs should read and follow all items in this document to the best of their ability and ask for clarification if something is confusing prior to use.

NPCs are required to have appropriate footwear and clothing for the weather. This clothing should include neutral base layers for costuming such as plain brown, grey, or black.

NPCs must have a sealable belt pouch for carrying Leaves and Resource cards for distribution as treasure.

NPCs should review event write ups, monster cards, modules, and NPCs prior to the event, if available. We are working hard to get these resources created in enough time to share with all players that are interested in NPCing, but sometimes we fall short of the mark. We hope to improve on this as we grow.
NPCs may play an NPC from the NPC folder at any point during the event. This will allow the town to feel more alive and reduce the possible boredom when downtime occurs and plot runners are indisposed. The folder characters will not be gendered to allow anyone to play them, and will include backstory, skills, and what leaves/items the NPC may take with them (treasure may not be changed unless directed by plot staff).

NPCs who bring additional costuming to make the character/monster more realistic or interesting may gain additional CP for their efforts.

NPCs are expected to take direction from the plot staff and play characters to the best of their ability. This does not mean that every NPC character should fight to the best of their physical ability. Play to the power level of the card and direction of the plot staff.

NPCs are expected to learn the layout of NPC shack and replace items where they go after use.
NPCs should have a basic knowledge of the site so they can be directed to different locations and take part in different styles of acting.

NPCs are expected to take part in combat, non-combat, and marshaling of modules throughout the course of an event. We understand not all players have the same physical abilities, so please talk with a plot member if you need a break or have a limitation that we need reminded of.

NPCs are expected to treat all props and costumes with respect. These are not your items and should not be mishandled or misused.
