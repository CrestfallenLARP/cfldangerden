Goblins have been pushed from civilized society due to their cruel nature and disgusting features. Due to having no morality, these creatures are always trying to take things that aren't theirs and to cause pain in any way possible. Some goblins see the benefit with working with Inspired to achieve their goals. These alliances are always short lived due to the goblins inclination towards chaos and short term gain.
