Factions - This section includes information on the factions, including acting information, basic costuming for each group, history, and monster cards.  We update each group as needed to show growth or transformation.

The Gnoll, Goblin, and Undead factions will also have special abilities based on their faction level. This level is clearly shown on the schedule page for the event and determines extra abilities that the faction members receive.

During weekend events, factions that are not tied to the primary story will have a number of missions to accomplish. These factions will act as the "random encounters" of the weekend. The faction level for these groups will change depending on the success and failure rate of these missions.  This gives NPCs that are combat oriented, goals to accomplish rather than just going out to die. The faction leads must ensure that these missions are handled fairly within the game. Sportsmanship is vital, so any out of character gloating or poking fun of players out of game is discouraged.
