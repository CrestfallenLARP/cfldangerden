Factions - This section will include information on the factions, including acting information, basic costuming for each group, and history.  We can update each group after each event to show growth or transformation.  IF we add new factions, they get added to the list.  I feel like each faction would have its own tab or section like the rules page or articles are organized.

2b. Monsters - This section will include information on individual monsters/creatures including cards, acting info, etc. This could be part of the factions page and just added as miscellaneous monsters or creatures.  This may cut down on top navigation.
