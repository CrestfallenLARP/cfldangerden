The undead have returned to Katalossa following their exile among the stars. They have destroyed countless other planets, planes, and living areas and have returned to consume the energy and destroy the essence of every other living source. The undead seem to have a gathered consciousness that drives them forward and link them in purpose. Undead will never willingly turn on each other.
