layout: role
Backstory: Jacob Coldren, is the leader of the adventuring group Gno More Gnolls and a trust fund baby. His hunting group is funded by his father, Giles Coldren a wealthy lumber smith. He is boisterous, a braggart, and thinks their group can do no wrong. His way is the best way, his info is the best info, their group is the best group, and so on. He will engage the adventurers in whatever way he can, as long as he can make it about himself. He is starting to discover that he has a penchant for killing especially when he is cheered for it. This dark side comes out when he is slaying the Gnolls and they have surrendered or are unprepared for him. He knows in his heart his lack of diligence and his willingness to buy his way into fame are not good traits but he doesn't want to disappoint his father and be left out of the will. He has sensed a change in his father's demeanor of late and is concerned that if he doesn't get his act together he will not inherit the lumberyard.
