title: Howard Sadler
layout: role
Backstory: Howard Sadler comes from a family of leathersmiths and tanners, and he doesn't wish to subject himself to that. A childhood friend of Jacob's Howard has always been Jacob's right hand guy, ever since they were kids. Jacob convinced Howard to join him and Azuk in hunting the gnolls, earning a paycheck as they went. Howard went along to keep an eye on Jacob hoping that Jacob would lose interest like most of his other hobbies. Howard is the brains of the operation. He draws up the maps, comes up with the strategy, and takes care of the negotiations for payment. . He always has Jacob's back, and will hype him up to anyone he meets. Sadly this venture seems to be getting out of hand. Howard sees that the Gnolls are not a threat that should be looked down at and the attitude that Jacob and Azuk are taking is far too cavalier about them. While he supports Jacob publicly... loudly, he is privatly very  worried that things are getting out of hand.
