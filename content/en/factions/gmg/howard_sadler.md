Howard Sadler is a childhood friend of Jacob's. Jacob convinced Howard to join him and Azuk in hunting the gnolls, earning a paycheck as they went. Howard is the brains of the operation. He draws up the maps, comes up with the strategy, and takes care of the negotiations for payment. Howard has always been Jacob's right hand guy, ever since they were kids. He always has Jacob's back, and will hype him up to anyone he meets. Howard won't talk about himself much, just that his family were leathersmiths and tanners, and he didn't wish to subject himself to that.
