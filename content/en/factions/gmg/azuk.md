title: Azuk
layout: role
Backstory: Azuk is an orc who Jacob took under his wing when young. Jacob's wealth and influence lead to Azuk trusting Jacob with his life. Azuk was the first person to get on board with the idea of Gno More Gnolls and he is the most excited about it overall. Azuk isn't the smartest orc in the bunch, but what he lacks in brains, he makes up for in brawn. Azuk adores Jacob, and views him as a father figure. Jacob can do no wrong, according to Azuk.
