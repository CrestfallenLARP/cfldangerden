###  

Ziggy was your run of the mill goblin, he would steal your shit and run away. One day when he was on a mission and ran into a mysterious man named Oz charmed him and became fast friends with him. When the charm took effect it caused Ziggy to see the good in life, that you can have friends other than those you grew up with. When the charm wore out he still could remember the feeling so he found a wand of charming and broke the crystal part of the wand and snorted it. This overdose of charm caused him to be charmed forever but he has his senses about him. He went back to the players and became friends with everyone. When they needed the bomb to be taken care of they asked him for help saying "he's the man." So he decided to help by running up to the bomb and hugging it and yelling "I AM THE MAN!". This cost him his last essence so he died...but because of his nature of not sitting still ...his essence decided to go on its own. He found a strange pirate crew that wanted to be free from their AI prison. Ziggy felt bad and decided that he wanted to be there to comfort them for their final moments...or at least they thought it was their final moments.
