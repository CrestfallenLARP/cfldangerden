<p class="text-center">Welcome to the Crestfallen LARP and thank you for trying our game. </p>
<p class="text-center">Crestfallen is an easy to play fantasy game system with an in-depth story and community. Character skills are simple, however their use within the game and roleplay associated with them are open to the players imagination. </p>
<p class="text-center">With the addition of open-ended crafting and research systems, as well as a continually growing game world driven by players thoughts and characters actions, we hope to build a supportive community of like-minded gamers who are here for the same reasons we are: A fun time, a good story, and a chance to be involved in something much bigger than ourselves.</p>

<div id='write'  class=''><p><span>I want the NPC page to feel thematically dark and different.  Similar to Legend of Zelda overworld vs the depths in Tears of the Kingdom or day vs night in a vampire the masquerade.  So, I think we should take the site and keep its layout looking the same as the main page, but using one of these color palates.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>

<p><span>Content wise I have the current thoughts. The tabs at the top should be </span></p><ol start='' ><li><p><span>Write Ups - which will list all of the event write ups with jobs, treasure, cards, etc which can be used to generate the treasure and track the events.  They should probably be laid out similar to the schedule page.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Factions - This section will include information on the factions, including acting information, basic costuming for each group, and history.  We can update each group after each event to show growth or transformation.  IF we add new factions, they get added to the list.  I feel like each faction would have its own tab or section like the rules page or articles are organized.</span></p><p><span>2b. Monsters - This section will include information on individual monsters/creatures including cards, acting info, etc. This could be part of the factions page and just added as miscellaneous monsters or creatures.  This may cut down on top navigation.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Characters - This section will list the important characters, who is playing them, their backstory, and their journey as the game continues.  This can be a place where players can see which characters are available to play.  I would like a small section that is in some way protected via password or has a link to google docs that only certain players can access.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Item Logs - much like you had described before, we want the items to be logged so that we can reference them later, print easier, and file them into write ups.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Props Guide - This may end up on the same page as the item log, but as a different tab.  I want to track what resources we have for loaning and NPC use and to make sure we have items available when they are needed for modules.</span></p></li></ol></div></div>
