title: Undead Panic
type: "docs"

A mass of red skeletal undead have been seen pushing through the area. They have taken over an old fortification not far from Briarwood. Rumor has it that a strong skeleton made of white bone has been teleporting across the area and gathering magical items and energy. Scout for 20 leaves, wipe out the area for 40 leaves, destroy the white bone undead for 100 leaves.
