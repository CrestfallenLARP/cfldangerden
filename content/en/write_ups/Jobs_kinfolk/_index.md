## NOTES FOR SCOTT

This is a general overview of the layout I have for the one day write ups.  The opening module always occurs as the first plot point, mid event are scattered throughout as wanted/needed, and End Module is usually the final goal for the one day.  To go with your style of integration I would want a place to link monster cards and treasure in each job.  Adding to this, for full events I would have 3 additional module types. Cards in the woods/Stockpiles are used for players to seek adventure rather than sign up for it. Random Encounters would be the section for the faction leads where I would notate their goals, what is needed to level them up, the stats they will use for the weekend, the treasure they will have, etc. Finally logistics modules are a set of modules that we will have written and saved in case there is someone who is bored and cannot figure out how to involve themselves in the other module styles.
