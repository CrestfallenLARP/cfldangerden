title: Reclaim stolen resources
---

A chest of stolen resources must be brought back, or no new items will be able to be created for next adventure day. 20 leaves if all resources are returned. 10 if any resources are mission.

This job is a search and rescue style mission.  A number of undead have stolen a large stockpile of resources from a caravan.  The players must destroy the undead and safely return with the resources.  This will allow all lineages/guilds to make new items for next event.  If this is not completed, the lineages/guilds don't have the resources to build anything.

Props: Chest with treasure and resource cards
