title: Raccoon Note
layout: module
schedule: opening
brief: This Module will be set up with Rayna and Rigby XXX. Rigby knows Rayna has been trying to get him to speak. His kind doesn't talk anymore, but they are still intelligent and helpful. He leaves a note written in garbage code that is found in the trash modules for kinfolk OR can be figured out on its own. The note says, - My cousins went can hopping and haven't come back. They have to be safe. Bring them back and I will give the saviors something fun. - If the PCs bring back the additional cousin stuffed animals, they will get an item and some leaves. 
props: Raccoon Stuffed Animals, Note
