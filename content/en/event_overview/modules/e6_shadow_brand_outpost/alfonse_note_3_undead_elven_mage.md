is giving the Undead an Elven Mage that was captured in exchange for a non agression pact between the guild and undead. Alfonse is aware this pact will be short lived, but will plant information of the creation of another white bone undead among the adventurers hoping it will be appropriate bait.

This is a hook for [Undead Ritual](/outskirts/modules/e6_undead_ritual/)

> Scholar Myriil has been a great boon for us. Rather than gifting the undead with one of our own mages, this lost Elf will make a much more efficient pawn. Tom will be given the offering letter, a formal request for peace as well as offering these two.... vassels for their cause.  We will have one of the other members draft the letter to minimize chances of bringing the undead upon us. The ritual to transform a living creature into an undead is unknown to the guild but will hopefully take a long enough time to be a draw for the locals.  The adventurers took care of one white boned undead, but it is unclear if this was a fluke or not.  The undead are dangerous, but should behave predictably.  The drop off will occur shortly before the tunnel collapse.  If Tom survives, we will clean up that loose end soon after his return.
