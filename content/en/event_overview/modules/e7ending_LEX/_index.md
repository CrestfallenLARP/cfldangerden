title: LEX Continued
layout: module
schedule: ending
brief: This module will occur at 9 PM. The story for this module will be very different depending on how the adventurers react to the over all story. If the adventurers convince talking with TOMY is bad and that they should stay at home, the undead try to force LEX into going through with the transformation. If the adventurers don't convince LEX, they will willingly take on the transformation. The Adventueres will need to either save LEX from transforming or fail and lose it to the undead. This will be a timed module to determine the fate of LEX. The timer will only start when the adventurers arrive, but they must not know this. The adventurers must reach LEX and remove the metal leads from the ground in time. The time will be 10 or 15 minutes depending on the marshal and if it feels the adventurers are moving with a purpose. More time should be given if the players are moving with a purpose and trying to save LEX. If LEX is saved, it gives its extreme thanks to the adventurers. If LEX is lost, the body goes limp and does not respond. LEX becomes a metal bone undead. The red bone undead will have 4 to 6 resets with 1 leaf per reset. They may be harvested for 1 basic resource. The white bone undead will have 1 leaf, 2 basic resource cards and an item card. PROP AI Transferance Case
