title: Speak with LEX
layout: module
schedule: opening
brief: This Module will occur at 9 AM. A clockwork automaton will come to town carrying the Speaker Box. The automaton will be followed and attacked by red bone undead. If attacked, the clockwork automaton will shut down after losing all body. After 1 minute, the automaton will power back up with full body and continue on its path. The creature cannot be searched for the Speaker Box as it grips it tightly while deactivated. Strength 2 or 3 may remove the box from the automaton, but it will continue to activate to re-acquire it. LEX will speak with OZ or Mattias at first and other adventurers following. LEX Speech. Hello my newly acquired friends. I have been most bored and lonely. I am looking to travel away from my abandoned library in order to see the world. I have been approached by an ingenious individual known as TOMY who has promised that they may be able to remove me from my domicile. I request your thoughts on what I should do regarding this request. This recording will be erased and replaced with your own....... now. The box will listen for 5 or 10 minutes depending on how the players react, then the automaton will turn around to head home. The red bone undead will have 2 resets and have 1 leaf per reset as treasure. They may be harvested from for 1 basic resource. 
props: Speaker Box
