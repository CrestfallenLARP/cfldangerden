title: Undead Ritual
layout: module
schedule: ending
brief: This is one module of 4 possible ending modules to try to minimize damage to Boulderton proper. The undead have been given a mage in order to turn into a new white bone. The mage is trapped within an undead holding area and a ritual is taking place to add the human mage to the collective intelligence. This ritual is being done on either the skull of the human or the living mage depending on how many NPCs are available and their knowledge on the game world and magic system.  Each undead has leaves and their are resources being used for the ritual including a rare enchanting resource.
