  LEX the librarian robot has been left alone for the past few weeks and has grown bored. He has recently been approached by a very knowledgeable stranger that has offered him freedom from his secluded library. He is considering the offer, as he is tired of being trapped and is in open conversation on HOW they can free him. Over the course of the event undead will hound the adventurers. LEX will ask Oz, Mattias, and other adventurers for advice. What LEX decides will ultimately depend on how interested the PCs are in helping him or if they just push him to the side.
