post: Don't tell any other lineage folks about this.  We need to keep this to ourselves.  We have been hearing voices and we think others of our kind have too.  They call to us.  We want to know what they want and who they are.  This is a solo mission.  If you want to track them down, just follow your instincts.  We need to know too.  Write us a report about what you find. 
reward: 20 leaves for 2 pages. Not bad.  If its something we can share, maybe you can sell it to the paper too!
draft: true
