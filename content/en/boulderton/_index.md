## Event Overview

The scouting of the wilds near Boulderton has been going well.  The Goblins and Gnolls have been scared from the area, though a few small groupings of them exist.  There is an elemental influx near Port Jebbeddo that needs to be investigated, Undead gathering in the wilds near Boulderton, and a strange organization forming under the symbol of an arrow pointed skyward.
