You ever got a problem with a low down scary gnoll
Mangy and stinky and mean
They kill in a pack and take a huge toll
They love to be obscene

You gotta get us, the GMG crew
The bravest in the land
Gno More Gnolls, we know what to do
The gnolls won't stand a chance!

No More Gnolls, that's who we are! 
We make them howl in fear! Ahrooo!
No More Gnolls! We are a huge star! 
We make them howl in fear! Ahrooo!

Gnolls attack, we distract, we keep your homes safe
Gnolls defend, we descend, we are your saving grace!
No job too big, no job too small,
We take on many, we take on all
For gnolls deserve killin'
They are the main villain
And we have a ball!

No More Gnolls, that's who we are! 
We make them howl in fear! Ahrooo!
No More Gnolls! We are a huge star! 
We make them howl in fear! Ahrooo!

Howie's my man
He's got the brains
Quiet, shy, and cunning
He makes the docs and keeps the plans
His brain is very stunning! 


And Azuk he's tall 
Green and mean
He'll take on any foe!
Brave and strong and none too bright,
Just point him were to go!

And El the fair, she's elven line
Healing is what she do
Fighting? Nah, and that's ok,
She still gets to split the loo-t!

We educate the populate on the weakness of our foe
We Exterminate, don't hesitate
We show nasty gnolls where to go!

No More Gnolls, that's who we are! 
We make them howl in fear! Ahrooo!
No More Gnolls! We are a huge star! 
We make them howl in fear! Ahrooo!
