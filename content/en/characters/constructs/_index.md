The Shadow Brand is a thieves guild that has a long hidden history in Katalossa. The guild originated in the city of Urnst found to the east of Briarwood, nestled between the mountains and desert. The Shadow Brand uses deception, manipulation, and secrets to fulfill their goals. This often includes short and long term planning, the organization of small cells of independent actors, and bribery/extortion of local commoners.
