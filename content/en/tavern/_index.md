So.... this is a great opportunity to make a reference guide for future games, a resource for the NPC site, and guide to the event. I have two thoughts. Paragons are what are called upon for the ritual. Characters are used to choose which paragons the group call upon. The characters have the interactions with the players. The paragons all have voice recordings for when called upon.  Each paragon should be a page, each character has 2. I will get a list of the paragons. I wont know how many characters for a week or two.



Paragons (x deities) were adventures that grew to define their lineages and bring them to prominence.



We can print large cards with their symbols on them and have them promptly posted for the players to choose. (Along with the candle style rep)









Each character can have a write up on what the character is about and important past, but grant the players questions like the knowledge skills to grant clarity regarding the choices.
